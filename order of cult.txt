**Leadership**: The Pyre Lord::

**Alignment**: Chaotic Neutral::

### Goal
The cult seeks to ignite the Final Conflagration, a global wildfire that will reduce all civilization to cinders. They believe this cataclysm will awaken the Undying Ember, a primordial fire-god slumbering beneath the world’s crust, who will then reshape the ashes into a "purer" existence—one free from greed, decay, and weakness. Their mantra: "Burn the corrupt, the cowardly, the complacent. Only the scorched may rise."
### Ability

"The fire recognizes its own."
Once per combat, the cultist can force a creature that took fire damage to make a DC 16 Con save. On a fail, flames leap to them at the start of their turn (1d6 fire damage per round until extinguished).

### Abstract
A fanatical order of fire-worshipers who see civilization as a prison, the Ashen Phoenix believes true rebirth can only come through total annihilation. They orchestrate catastrophes—wildfires, volcanic eruptions, arson sprees—not out of malice, but devotion. Each blaze is a prayer to their slumbering god, The Undying Ember, a primordial force they claim will awaken once the world is reduced to cinders. Their mantra: "Burn the chains of the past. Rise from the ash."

:
### Hierarchy
The cult is structured like a wildfire—chaotic, but with a deadly pattern. At the heart blazes The Pyre Lord, a prophet whose body is more ash than flesh, their voice like crackling timber. They commune directly with the Undying Ember through visions in the flames. Below them are the Cinder Apostles, arsonist-mystics who plant "sacred fires" in cities, disguised as preachers or healers until they ignite their suicide brands. The Emberborn are frontline zealots, their lungs adapted to smoke, their weapons dipped in alchemical napalm. At the bottom smolder the Kindling, desperate souls who join for protection or vengeance, only to realize too late they’re just fuel for the next blaze.

Unique to the Phoenix is the Phoenix Cycle—when a member dies in flame, the cult debates whether their ashes show "the spark of rebirth." If so, their name is chanted for a year; if not, they’re forgotten before the embers cool.

:
### History
The Ashen Phoenix began with a single, unstoppable spark—the self-immolation of **High Priestess Veyra the Unburnt**, who walked into her burning temple rather than recant her visions. As the flames consumed her, she didn't scream—she **sang**, and the fire bent to her melody. When the ashes cooled, she stood unharmed, her skin now cracked porcelain, her hair living smoke, and in her hands she clutched the **Heart Cinder**, a blackened stone that pulsed like a dying star. The surviving congregation fell to their knees as she spoke the prophecy: *"All that is rigid shall crack. All that is corrupt shall burn. From these ashes, we rise."*  

Their true power awoke when they rediscovered the **Phoenix Codex**, a text written in combustible ink that only revealed its secrets as it burned. Each page contained apocalyptic visions—cities falling to carefully placed fires, volcanoes awakened by sacrificial pyres, and most terrifying, the **Undying Ember** itself stirring beneath the earth. The Codex's final page was blank... until Veyra

pressed her flaming hand to it, revealing their divine mandate: *"Burn the world twice—first to cleanse, then to rebirth."* Their first great act, **The Purification of Lyskar**, saw an entire city reduced to cinders in a single night, yet the cult's temple stood untouched at the center, its walls now bearing the faces of those deemed "worthy" in the ash.  

A faction arose worshipping not rebirth, but **endless fire**—they believed the Undying Ember should never be awakened, that the world should burn eternally. The resulting **Schism of Cinders** turned cultist against cultist in battles where the very air combusted. It ended when Veyra (or something wearing her charred visage) appeared in the flaming ruins of their grand monastery and **ate the Heart Cinder**, her body dissolving into a living wildfire that consumed both sides equally. The survivors emerged with blackened eyes that saw through smoke, and one command: *"Burn wisely."*  

Their magnum opus—**The Final Conflagration**—proved their ultimate thesis: *fire could judge*. When they burned the island nation of Talsin, the flames spared every firstborn child, every unread book, and every spot where an act of true love had occurred. The cult walked through the ruins collecting these "chosen remnants," placing them in fireproof shrines to await the new world.  

Now, they lurk in burning places, their **Cinder Apostles** and **Emberborn** preparing for the **Great Spark**—when they will ignite the world's final pyre and dance in the ashes of history.  

### **Timeline of The Ashen Phoenix**  
- **Founding Era:** Veyra the Unburnt survives her pyre and claims the Heart Cinder.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Phoenix Codex** is decoded through controlled burns.  
- **Expansion Era:** "Accidental" fires spread the cult's influence across nations.  
- **Schism Era:** The **Schism of Cinders** divides the cult over eternity versus rebirth.  
- **Ascendance Era:** **The Final Conflagration** of Talsin proves fire can judge worth.  
- **Present Era:** The Phoenix prepares the **Great Spark**—a fire to end all fires.  

### Location and Base
A colossal, open-air temple built inside the caldera of a dormant volcano. Its "pews" are staggered stone slabs where bound prisoners kneel, not to pray, but to await ascension—a rain of liquid fire that pours from the ceiling when the Undying Ember’s voice rumbles through the earth. The walls are lined with Cinder Cells, fireproof alcoves holding artifacts and people "saved" for the new world, their faces pressed against glass-like obsidian doors. At the center gapes the Maw of Rebirth, a pit where the cult’s high priests hurl themselves during rituals, only to emerge days later with blackened skin and molten gold eyes.

### Pecularity
The Ashen Phoenix doesn’t merely burn—it curates destruction. They spare art, libraries, and even people they deem "worthy," sealing them in fireproof shrines to survive the apocalypse. Their fires burn unnaturally hot but leave cryptic patterns in the ash: spirals that predict future disasters, or faces of those destined to reign in the new world. Most chilling? Their pyres never smoke—the dead’s souls are said to feed the Undying Ember directly.
:
### Public Perception
To most, the Ashen Phoenix are folk horror—a rumor of "fire-witches" blamed for droughts and wildfires. Rulers dismiss them as mad cultists… until their cities burn in suspiciously precise patterns. The cult’s most terrifying trait is its perverse mercy: they leave survivors, but only those who pass their inscrutable tests. A child found unharmed in ashes, a library standing amid ruins—these "miracles" seed doubt. Is this divine will, or just arson with pretensions? The poor whisper that the Phoenix judges fairly, while the wealthy lock away their treasures in fireproof vaults, praying they’re deemed "worthy."
:
### Membership
To join is to surrender to the flame. Initiates undergo the Branding of the Chosen, where a sacred brazier sears a phoenix sigil into their flesh—a mark that never heals and glows when near heat. The devout become Emberborn, their lungs adapted to smoke, their blood running unnaturally hot. The most zealous ascend to Cinder Apostles, replacing limbs with molten prosthetics that drip fire. At the bottom smolder the Kindling, desperate souls who volunteer as arsonists, unaware they’ll be the first sacrificed when their usefulness ends. The highest rank, Phoenix Guard, are those who have died in fire and been "reborn"—their skin cracked like cooled lava, their voices the sound of wind through burning ruins.
:
### Code of Conduct
"Burn the unworthy. Preserve the pure. Rise from the ash." The cult operates under three immutable laws: First, fire must never be wasted—each blaze should serve either purification or prophecy. Second, no one may kill with flame unless they are willing to burn alongside their victim, ensuring conviction. Third, anything spared by their fires is sacred and must be protected for the new world. Disobedience is punished by the Cinder Trial—the offender is bound in fireproof chains and thrown into a ritual pyre; if the flames reject them, they are deemed corrupt and executed by blade instead.

##### Veil of Smoldering Prophecy
{margin-left:-12px}
:::::::::
### Secret
The cult doesn’t just worship rebirth through fire—they seek to unmake the cycle of death itself. Their true goal is to ignite the Pyre of the First Flame, a primordial conflagration that will reduce all existence to ash, allowing only the "worthy" (their followers) to rise again in a world without decay. The cursed Ember Codex is not just a tool—it’s a fragment of the First Flame, and each time it’s used, reality grows more brittle, like charred parchment ready to crumble.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## The Ember Codex

*Legendary, Requires Attunement (Cursed)*
}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This charred grimoire is bound in the still-smoking skin of a self-immolating prophet, its pages made from compressed volcanic glass that cuts fingers. The text flickers like trapped firelight, rewriting itself when unattended—not with ink, but with creeping flames that burn without consuming. To "read" it is to let the embers sear the words directly into your retinas.  



#### **Properties**  
- **Pyre of Revelation:** As an action, you can recite a passage aloud. All creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Wisdom save or suffer one of the following: 

  - *Cinderstruck:* Their blood boils (3d10 fire damage + 1d4 exhaustion as steam vents from their pores).  
:
  - *Ashen Epiphany:* They gain truesight but see only the moment of their death (disadvantage on all attacks/saves for 1 minute).  
  - *Phoenix Cycle:* They drop to 1 HP and burst into harmless flames—if they die within the next hour, they resurrect with 1 HP (once per creature).  
:
- **Resurrection Rite:** Once per long rest, burn a corpse with the Codex’s flames. It rises as an **Ashen Revenant** (see below), its hollow bones filled with swirling cinders that reform unless doused in holy water.  

- **Final Incantation:** When you would die, the Codex consumes your body in a pillar of blue fire. You reform at dawn from the ashes with all injuries healed, but 1d4 random memories are erased—replaced with visions of a crumbling obsidian tower.

### The Pyre Lord's Backstory
Before he became a prophet of ash and flame, he was Kaelan the Unbroken—a philosopher who studied the downfall of empires not with lament, but with reverence. Where others saw tragedy, Kaelan saw transformation. He believed collapse was not failure, but a necessary shedding of illusions. It was in destruction, he argued, that the world revealed its truest self. That belief became obsession.

His fate changed amidst the scorched ruins of Ashk’haret, a city swallowed by fire centuries before his birth. Beneath its vitrified stones and melted idols, he discovered a relic: a blackened ember that pulsed faintly, as though struggling to breathe. He called it the Heart Cinder. When he pressed it to his chest, it did not simply burn—it burrowed through skin and bone, fusing with his heart. Visions followed: cities consumed by wildfire, tyrants melted to slag, and phoenixes soaring through crimson skies. The Cinder showed him a world reborn in flame, and he believed.

That night, Kaelan led his fellow scholars into the desert to "witness the truth." By morning, only he remained. His skin had cracked like parched clay, and molten light threaded his veins. The others were nothing but ash and bone. He no longer spoke with a human voice—what escaped his lips was the dry rasp of kindling catching flame.

From this rebirth rose the Pyre Lord.

He founded the Ashen Phoenix, a cult that preached fire as redemption. Destruction, he taught, was not death—it was clarity. The cult moved through the world like a slow-burning fuse. Fires "accidentally" consumed libraries. "Unfortunate" blazes tore through tenements, workshops, embassies. No flame was ever lit by his hand. His followers interpreted the Heart Cinder’s will, believing that only those who choose to burn could be truly reborn.

And still, he offered mercy. When he stood before his enemies, he gave them a choice: burn now, or burn later. Some wept. Some knelt. Some, upon gazing into the fire, saw something beautiful—and joined him willingly.

Now, Kaelan’s body is more ember than man. The Heart Cinder has devoured his jaw, leaving only a molten cavity that devours charcoal, soot, and molten glass. His eyes smoulder with inner heat, and the air around him smells of scorched pine and sulfur. His touch leaves blistered scripture on skin. His tears hiss into smoke before they fall.

But in his dreams, he walks through a world made entirely of flame—a new creation born from the ashes of the old. Cities drift on plumes of cinder. The sky is painted in permanent dusk. In this vision, he is not a man but a pillar of fire, the first prophet of the Undying Ember.

He knows the final act of the Ashen Phoenix will consume even him. And he welcomes it.

Because fire, to the Pyre Lord, is not destruction. It is the beginning of truth.

### Veil of Smoldering Prophecy's Backstory
Born as Elara the Clear-Eyed, the Oracle was once a seer who predicted natural disasters with uncanny accuracy—until she foresaw the Undying Ember’s awakening. The vision burned her eyes to cinders, but the Pyre Lord found her weeping black tears and offered her a "gift": a Phoenix Feather quill dipped in her own molten eyes. Now, she writes prophecies on her own skin, the letters healing into scars as the feather burns her flesh. Her predictions are never wrong, but each one costs her a memory of the world as it is—she no longer recalls grass, only ash; laughter, only screams.

The cult reveres her as a living scripture. She sits chained in a sanctum of black mirrors, where reflections show possible futures as infernos. Her prophecies guide the cult’s targets: "The merchant prince’s greed will spark the docks’ purification" or "The orphanage’s sorrow is tinder for the great blaze." The more she writes, the less human she becomes—her hair is now smoke, her fingers charcoal sticks that crumble and regrow.

Her final prophecy, etched across her torso, reads: "You will kneel to me in the new world." She doesn’t know if it refers to the Pyre Lord... or herself.

### Additional Notes For GMs
The cult’s flames are sentient. Describe them "licking toward" potential fuel, and have Revenants prioritize those already burning.

### Hook I
The hamlet of Blackmend sits untouched in a sea of ash, its thatched roofs and wooden fences eerily pristine while the surrounding forest lies in smoldering ruin. The villagers speak of a "blessing" from a wandering fire-priest who saved them—but their eyes dart nervously to the charred stone altar at the town’s center. Each night at moonrise, a family is chosen by lot to "feed the flame." The chosen one walks willingly into the pyre, their body vanishing before the fire can consume them. In return, the inferno never spreads beyond the village borders.

When the party arrives, they find the latest offering—a mute orphan named Lina—floating above the pyre, wreathed in blue flames but unharmed. The villagers are torn between awe and terror, for Lina now speaks in a chorus of scorched voices, whispering of a "great burning to come." The Ashen Phoenix has taken notice. By midnight, Cinderborn assassins arrive to "collect the prophet," their bodies flickering like dying embers. If the party protects Lina, the villagers will turn on them, desperate to maintain their cursed salvation. If they hand her over, the cult gains a living key to the First Flame. And if they investigate the altar? They’ll find it’s not stone—it’s compacted ash, shaped into a screaming face.

### Hook II
The alchemist Eramus Telvanni collapses in the market square, his skin covered in glowing sigils that pulse like dying coals. His final act is to thrust a scorched page into the party’s hands—a fragment of the Ember Codex depicting their deaths in intricate fire-glyphs. Research reveals the symbols match an obscure prophecy: "When the Black Tower walks, the First Flame wakes."

The tower—Pyrehold—is a migratory monolith that appears only near the cult’s grand rituals. It now looms over the ruins of Hearthmire Abbey, its obsidian walls radiating unbearable heat. Inside, the party finds a nightmare: the abbey’s monks, now Ashen Revenants, endlessly reenact their own immolation in silent agony. The high priestess, Ignacia the Unburnt, floats at the heart of the tower, her body a living conduit for the First Flame. She is mid-ritual, her voice a crackling roar as she recites the Final Immolation—but the pages are missing from the Codex.

The party holds the last piece. If they destroy it, the ritual fails... but the tower’s collapse triggers a firestorm that consumes the region. If they complete the Codex, Ignacia becomes a Phoenix Avatar, and the First Flame’s awakening begins. And if they hesitate? The Revenants remember them—and drag them into the cycle.

### Goal
The Veil of Smoldering Prophecy seeks to incinerate all false destinies, ensuring that only the "true" future remains. They believe that every choice branches into illusions, and their sacred duty is to burn away deception—whether it be the lies of kings, the promises of gods, or even their own doubts. Their ultimate ritual, the "Great Conflagration of Possibility," involves igniting a pyre of written prophecies, collapsing all potential timelines into a single, inevitable fate. They do not care if this destiny is glorious or tragic—only that it is unavoidable.
### Ability

As a bonus action, a cultist pricks their palm and speaks a command. One creature within 30 feet must obey a 10-word phrase (e.g., “Kneel,” “Drop your weapon”) or take 3d6 psychic damage (Wisdom DC 15 half).

### Abstract
Deep within the twilight glades where mortal paths twist into fey realms, the Blackthorn Pact conducts its grim revels—a cabal of elven aristocrats who have traded nobility for savagery. They believe that by spilling blood in the name of an ancient fey horror known as The Thrice-Hollow Stag, they preserve the wild, untamed essence of the world. To them, mortals are not people but prey, and every hunt is a sacred rite, a dance of cruelty that sustains the balance between the civilized and the primal. The Pact’s members are not mere killers; they are artists of suffering, turning each chase into a performance, each death into an offering. Their victims are given a "fair" chance—a head start, a hidden blade, a whispered clue—but the outcome is always the same: torn flesh, broken bones, and laughter ringing through the trees. The Stag watches from the shadows, its antlers crowned with the memories of the slain, and the Pact’s most devoted hunters swear they hear it speak in the moment before the kill.

:
### Hierarchy
The Blackthorn Pact is structured like a perverse reflection of a royal court, where status is earned not through diplomacy but through brutality. At its apex stands Lord Varys Duskthorn, the undisputed master of the hunt, whose word is law. Below him are the Horned Lords, elite hunters who have each performed a ritual slaying in the Stag’s name, their right to lead sealed by the antlers they wear as crowns. The Grim Stalkers serve as enforcers, tracking down those who flee the hunts or betray the Pact’s secrets, while the Blood Poets are artists of cruelty, composing songs and paintings from the suffering of their prey. At the lowest rung are the Thornbound, initiates who must prove themselves by bringing a live sacrifice to the Stag’s altar—failure means becoming prey themselves. The Oracle exists outside this hierarchy, a living conduit of the Stag’s will, feared even by Varys.

:
### History
The Veil of Smoldering Prophecy was born from **a single, burning page**—the last testament of **Oracle-King Vareth the Unbound**, a ruler who saw his own death in the flames of his palace’s hearth. Rather than flee, he thrust his hands into the fire and **scrawled his fate onto his skin**, rewriting it letter by searing letter. When the assassins came, their blades passed through him like smoke—for he had already burned away the future where he died. His court, witnessing this defiance of destiny, gathered around

##### The Pyre of Unwritten Tomorrows
::::::
}}

{{wide

}}
  
the pyre of his throne and began **cutting their own truths into flesh**, each scar a rebellion against the lies of fate.  

Their true power manifested when they discovered the **Ashen Lectern**, an obsidian slab that floated above a lake of molten ink. Any prophecy written upon it **became immutable**, a fixed point in time that could not be unwritten. Their first great act, the **"Conflagration of False Dawns,"** saw them burn an entire library of royal decrees—and as the parchment turned to ash, the laws themselves vanished from history. Kings awoke with no memory of their crowns, treaties dissolved into nonsense, and the Veil walked through the chaos, rewriting the world in their own image.  

A schism arose when a faction sought to **preserve destiny rather than burn it**, believing some prophecies were sacred. The resulting **War of Ember and Ink** saw reality itself fray as rival scribes scratched out each other’s futures mid-battle. Cities flickered in and out of existence, soldiers died in timelines where they had never been born, and the sky rained **burning letters**—the discarded drafts of fate. The war ended when the Veil herself (or a being wearing her smoldering visage) inscribed a single word on the battlefield: **"ENOUGH."** The survivors awoke with their mouths full of ash, knowing only that they must **keep writing**.  

Their magnum opus—**The Pyre of Unwritten Tomorrows**—proved their ultimate truth: *"Fate is not written. It is burned."* An entire kingdom’s possible futures were set ablaze, leaving only one path forward—a world where the Veil alone decided what was real. By the last ember’s glow, only their cult remained, their bodies now **living scrolls** etched with the only truths that mattered.  

Now, they wander the world, their **Quillbearers** and **Flame-Scribes** carving prophecies into the flesh of kings and beggars alike. Their final work? The **Great Conflagration of Possibility**, where every lie, every uncertain future, will be set aflame—until only **one inevitable truth remains**.  

### Timeline  

- **Founding Era:** Oracle-King Vareth defies his death by rewriting it in fire.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Ashen Lectern** is found, allowing prophecies to be made absolute.  
- **Expansion Era:** The Veil burns false histories, erasing them from memory.  
- **Schism Era:** The **War of Ember and Ink** fractures the cult over destiny’s sanctity.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The **Pyre of Unwritten Tomorrows** annihilates alternate futures.  
- **Present Era:** The Veil prepares the **Great Conflagration**, where only one fate will survive.

### Location and Base
The cult's sanctum exists within the hollowed corpse of a dead god - a massive volcanic caldera where the stone walls still bleed black ichor that burns without consuming itself. The air shimmers with heat distortion, making the thousands of burning books that line the shelves appear to flicker in and out of existence. These tomes - the *Libram of Might-Have-Beens* - each contain alternate timelines that crackle and rewrite themselves in real fire, their pages eternally burning yet never turning to ash.  

At the heart of the chamber floats the Ashen Lectern, a twenty-foot tall monolith of fused bone and volcanic glass where the Hierophant inscribes prophecies using a quill made from a phoenix's last feather. The ground consists of powdered prophecies - walk across it and your footprints briefly glow with words describing your death before being swept away by an unfelt wind. Strange fire-spirits, embodiments of abandoned futures, flit between the stacks, their forms shifting between humanoid and bestial as they tend the flames. The temperature increases the closer one gets to the lectern - at its base, the heat is so intense that metal begins to glow red, and unprotected flesh blisters instantly. Yet the cultists move unharmed, their scarred bodies drinking in the heat like parched earth welcomes rain.  

:
### Pecularity
The cult’s most unsettling trait is their absolute silence in the presence of fire. When flames burn, they cease all speech, communicating only through scar-script—words carved into their own flesh with heated blades. These scars never fully heal, and over time, the oldest members are little more than walking manuscripts, their bodies covered in layers of prophetic text. They believe that fire is the only honest voice, and thus, when it speaks, they must listen. This extends to combat—if a spell or weapon produces fire, the cultists stop talking mid-sentence, switching to eerie, coordinated sign language.
:
### Public Perception
To outsiders, the Blackthorn Pact are mad prophets wrapped in their own suffering, a cult of self-mutilating fanatics who see destiny in every drop of blood. Common folk fear them not for their violence, but for their terrible accuracy—when a Pact scribe carves a prophecy, it will come to pass, one way or another. Kings hire them as advisors, then exile them when their predictions grow too dire. Peasants leave offerings of blank parchment and fresh knives at crossroads, hoping to avoid their attention. The church condemns them as "heretics of the future", while scholars quietly seek them out, desperate to know if their life’s work will mean anything. The Pact does not care what the world thinks—they know the truth burns brightest when all else is ash.

##### Lady Sylessa Moonshadow

:::::::::
### Membership
To join the Blackthorn Pact, a seeker must first surrender a lie they once believed. This is not metaphorical—they must carve it into their own flesh, then hold the wound over a flame until the words blacken and curl. If they endure the pain without crying out, they are given a quill made from their own fingerbone and taught the art of scar-script. Full members, known as Flame-Scribes, are expected to inscribe at least one prophecy per week, each one a potential future burned into their skin. The most devout become Quillbearers, their bodies so covered in scars that they resemble living manuscripts. A rare few, those who have written prophecies that came true in spectacular fashion, are granted the honor of carrying the Veil’s ink—a vial of molten obsidian that sears words into reality itself.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## The Thrice-Cursed Antlers

*Legendary, Requires Attunement (Cursed)* 
}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
These jagged black antlers, still damp with immortal blood, once crowned the brow of the Thrice-Hollow Stag. Now bound in silver-thorned vines to form a twisted hunting mask, the artifact pulses with the memories of every soul taken in the Stag’s name. When worn, the antlers fuse to the bearer’s skull, their points curling inward like grasping fingers to pierce the wearer’s temples.  
:::::
#### **Properties**  
- **Bloodsense:** You automatically detect the location of any wounded creature within 1 mile. Their pulse echoes in your ears like drumbeats, growing louder as they weaken.  
- **The Stag’s Gift:** Once per hunt, you may reroll a failed attack against a creature that has taken damage this turn. On a hit, the target’s wounds bloom with thorned vines (1d6 piercing damage per round until healed magically).  
- **Fair Chase:** You cannot attack a creature that hasn’t acted yet in combat. If you reduce a creature to 0 HP, you must spend your next turn ritually arranging their corpse in a "graceful" pose (grants no mechanical benefit, but the Pact observes this tradition religiously).

### Lord Varys Duskthorn's Backstory
Varys Duskthorn was born beneath the gilded canopy of ancient woods, heir to one of the oldest elven bloodlines—a lineage steeped in grace, honour, and the long memory of empire. From an early age, he was taught the songs of the Verdant Courts, where elves were not just stewards of the wild, but its chosen voice. Yet as he watched the mortal realms fester—cities sprawling like infections, their chimneys vomiting smoke into sacred skies—Varys felt only revulsion. The ballads rang hollow to him, mere lullabies masking the rot beneath civilisation’s veneer.

His disdain festered into fury. He saw the treaties with men, dwarves, and lesser things as cowardice—capitulations that traded sovereignty for peace. Elvenkind, in his view, had forgotten its teeth.

His awakening came during the Rite of the Autumn Hunt, a solemn ritual to honour nature's cycle of death and renewal. But Varys, brash and burning with contempt, broke from the hunting party and delved alone into the Ashgrove Deep—a place older than memory, where even druids dared not tread. There, beneath a dying moon, he encountered the Thrice-Hollow Stag, a towering creature of bone, bark, and black mist. Its antlers stretched like dead trees; its eyes were bottomless voids. It did not speak in words, but in images: crimson forests, endless hunts, the poetry of prey. It showed him what the world could be—not a balance, but a reckoning.

When he returned, Varys no longer spoke of harmony. His eyes held no reflection of the stars, only shadow. The hunt had changed him.

Under his guidance, the Blackthorn Pact—once a secluded conclave of traditionalists—became something far darker. He transformed them into a cult of predation, devoted not to the preservation of nature, but to its dominion. The strong must consume the weak. That was nature’s true law.

His greatest ritual is the Grand Hunt, held once a year when the blood-moon rises. Captured mortals—nobles, warriors, scholars, children—are set loose into the Weald of Thorns, a cursed forest bristling with illusions, traps, and ancient hunger. They are given weapons and a false promise: survive until dawn, and they go free. None have ever returned. Varys does not kill in haste. He stalks. He studies. He waits for the moment when the light dies in their eyes—that exquisite instant when hope breaks.

He feeds these deaths to the Thrice-Hollow Stag, believing each one strengthens its presence in the waking world. For Varys, this is not cruelty—it is clarity. The lie of civilisation must be hunted to extinction. He does not hate mortals; he simply sees them as meat that forgot its place.

Varys Duskthorn, once heir to song and legend, has become the sharp edge of an ancient truth: the world is not made for peace—it is made for the chase.

### Lady Sylessa Moonshadow's Backstory
Sylessa was once a radiant figure among the seers of the Summer Court, her presence a song of sunlight and foresight. She was born with the gift—or perhaps the burden—of visions that danced beyond the edges of possibility: futures that shimmered like dew and vanished just as quickly. At first, her prophecies were welcomed, glimpses of might-have-beens that amused the fey aristocracy. But her visions began to shift. She saw rot blooming beneath the roots of the oldest trees, rivers running dry, and mortal fires encroaching on the timeless wilds. She spoke of magic unraveling, of steel cities devouring song and starlight. Her warnings soured the revels and stirred unease. The Summer Court, ever fond of beauty and denial, called her mad and cast her out, her voice silenced beneath laughter.

Banished from the eternal gardens, Sylessa wandered the liminal spaces where realms bleed into each other—thorn-choked glades, moonless moors, and paths that only appear in dreams. It was there, beneath a sky of pale green stars, that the Thrice-Hollow Stag found her. No ordinary beast, the Stag was a being older than time, its antlers branching like bone runes, its breath fogging the veil between life and death. It did not speak, but she understood its offer. Where once she had only seen the future, she could now shape it. Bound in a silent pact, Sylessa became the Oracle of the Hunt. She reads omens in the steaming entrails of prey, scatters bones beneath blood-moons, and whispers the Stag’s will to Varys, warlord and chosen instrument of its hunger.

Sylessa’s prophecies never lie, but their truth is carved from her like meat from bone. Each vision costs her a year of life, leaving her frame ever more withered, her skin stretched thin as vellum over flickering veins. Her eyes glow faintly, touched by something no longer fey, no longer mortal. She no longer dreams as others do; her sleep is a theatre of the Stag’s hunts—red fields, screaming horns, and a silence more terrifying than sound. She wakes with blood on her lips and names on her tongue. Among the Pact, she is both venerated and feared; her words dictate who will be spared, who will be hunted, and when the next Grand Hunt will drench the woods in crimson. She alone knows the true name of the Thrice-Hollow Stag, and she guards it with her soul, for to speak it aloud would be to unchain it completely—and Sylessa, even in her fading years, fears what might follow.

The Codex’s changes are subtle at first—a misplaced item, a name no one recalls. But with each use, the cracks in reality grow. Let players notice inconsistencies.

### Code of Conduct
The Blackthorn Pact operates under a single, unbreakable law: "No prophecy shall be spoken aloud unless it is first written in blood." Their members believe that words are too fleeting, too easily twisted—only scar-script, carved into flesh and sealed with fire, carries the weight of truth. Breaking this rule is punishable by "the Unwriting", where the offender’s skin is flayed and used as parchment for a new prophecy. They enforce a brutal hierarchy: senior scribes may edit the scars of juniors, but only the Veil herself may strike through a prophecy entirely. Their rituals are conducted in silence, the only sounds being the hiss of blades on skin and the crackle of burning vellum. To speak without writing is heresy; to write without burning is sacrilege.
:
### Secret
The Blackthorn Pact believes the Codex is a gift from their patron, but in truth, it is a prison for an ancient archfey’s rival. The thorns are the remnants of a duel between two fey lords, and the book’s power comes from the trapped entity’s screams. If the Codex is burned in a sacred grove under a full moon, the archfey is freed—and the Pact’s magic unravels.
:
### Hook I
The mayor's hands tremble as she clutches a child's torn dress to her chest, the fabric still smelling faintly of lavender. "Her name was Elara," she whispers, though the town records show no birth certificate, no census listing, no evidence the girl ever existed. The villagers humor their leader's grief with pitying looks, whispering that the stress of office has fractured her mind. But when the party investigates, they find disturbing gaps in reality—a bedroom preserved like a shrine behind a walled-up door, a tiny handprint fossilized in the drying mortar of the town well, a lullaby the mayor sings in her sleep that none of the local bards recognize.

The truth is worse than a missing child. Elara still walks among them. Twelve years old and hollow-eyed, she serves the Blackthorn Pact as a "Living Parchment"—her skin covered in glowing scars where the Thorned Codex has rewritten her very identity. She doesn't remember the accident that killed her little brother, doesn't recall begging the Pact to undo her existence so her mother wouldn't suffer. Now she assists the cult's archivists without recognition, her own mother's desperate hugs feeling like assaults from a stranger. The Thorn Wraith stalking the party isn't just eliminating witnesses—it's ensuring Elara never tries to reclaim the name carved into that windowsill.
::::
### Hook II
The historian's ink-stained fingers leave smears on the party's sleeves as he shoves the decaying treaty into their hands. "Read it!" he demands, though the parchment lies blank. "It described the Armistice of the Twin Crowns—proof the war ended!" But the library around them is rewriting itself in real time—portraits of the peacemaking king now show a warlord, history books detail battles that never happened, and the scholar's own research notes bleed away as ink reverses up the quill. In the streets, veterans of a war that supposedly never was stagger with phantom wounds, while merchants grow fat trading weapons for a conflict the world no longer remembers averting.

Beneath the city, the Blackthorn Pact conducts their grand revision. The Thorned Codex floats above a pool of liquid memory, its pages fanning as cultists drip their own blood into the inkwell. With each stroke of their bone quills, another clause of history dissolves—the peace treaty becomes a declaration of war, dead heroes are recast as traitors, and the Pact's patrons are inserted as saviors who will profit from the coming bloodshed. But reality is fraying at the edges. Party members catch glimpses of their own altered pasts—a rogue might remember dying in an alley, the cleric recalls serving a god that doesn't exist. To stop the Pact, they must navigate a dungeon that changes behind them, where even slain enemies might return as rewritten versions of themselves.
:
### Encounter table
| Roll | Encounter | Description |
|:----:|:-----------:|---------|  
| 1  | **Thornscribes** | Cultists (1d4) with quills that write in blood. They can **edit their own injuries** (reduce damage taken by 1d10). |  
| 2  | **The Hollow Chronicler** | A pact leader whose eyes are empty pits. They recite false histories, forcing listeners to make Wisdom saves (DC 15) or believe them. |  
| 3  | **Bramble Husks** | Animated armor filled with thorns. On death, they burst (2d6 piercing damage in 10 ft.). |  
| 4  | **Memory Thief** | A fey-touched rogue who steals faces (disguises as someone the party knows). |  
| 5  | **The Unwritten** | A ghostly figure erased by the Codex. It attacks those who remember it. |  
| 6  | **Oathbound Executioner** | A hulking brute with a contract burned into its chest. It pursues a target relentlessly. |

##### Veylis the Unbound

{{OrgName
## The Chainbreakers
}}
:::
{{monster,orgstat
{{columns:2,statpart1



**Leadership**: Veylis the Unbound::

**Alignment**: Chaotic Neutral::

}}
---
### Goal
The Chainbreakers wage an eternal war against all forms of bondage, their ultimate goal being the complete unraveling of cosmic order through three sacred acts of liberation. First comes the Breaking of Mortal Chains, where they systematically dismantle earthly power structures through calculated regicide and societal collapse. Each slain ruler falls to a weapon forged from the previous victim's crown, their death throes echoing through the hollowed halls of abandoned palaces. The cult leaves no throne standing, no law unbroken, replacing kingdoms with anarchic voids where the very concept of rulership withers.
### Ability

Final Unshackling - When reduced to 0 HP, a cultist’s bonds explode (10-ft radius, all restraints destroyed).





}}

\column
::::::::::

### Abstract
A shadowy network of revolutionaries, assassins, and broken idealists, the Chainbreakers worship The Unshackled, a forgotten god of freedom who was torn apart by the other deities for daring to challenge divine law. The cult believes all hierarchy is a prison—whether mortal kings or cosmic order—and their sacred duty is to "shatter the chains of fate." They orchestrate regicides, prison breaks, and societal collapses, leaving behind only a single token: a broken iron link. Their ultimate goal? To resurrect their shatered god by creating enough chaos to destabilize reality itself.

:
### Hierarchy
At the top stands Veylis the Unbound, his very touch unraveling divine law. Below him drifts The Nameless Whisper, her prophecies transcribed by the Fate-Scribes, prisoners who carve her visions into their flesh with stolen knives. The Linkbreakers are elite assassins who specialize in killing rulers and destroying symbolic chains (oathstones, wedding rings, even children's cradle ties). The Unmarked are spies who wear slave brands as disguises, infiltrating palaces as "loyal servants." At the bottom are the Forgotten, volunteers who submit to eternal imprisonment so they can break others free from within.

:
### History
The Chainbreakers began with a single, shatered link—the broken manacle of **Veylis the Unbound**, a slave-gladiator who tore the celestial brands from his flesh with his teeth. When his executioners tried to hang him for killing his master, the rope snapped—not from weakness, but because the noose itself recoiled from his touch. As he lay gasping in the dirt, the voice of **The Unshackled** whispered from the hanging tree: *"They fear what cannot be bound."* By dawn, every chain in the prison had rusted to dust, and Veylis walked free—carrying the executioner's severed hands as his first holy relic.  

Their true power awoke when they recovered the **God's Shackle**, a fragment of the divine chains that once bound The Unshackled. When worn, it didn't just break physical bonds—it shatered *conceptual* ones: oaths dissolved, laws unraveled, even time itself stuttered in its presence. Their first miracle, **The Night of Unknotted Tongues**, saw an entire city's population suddenly speak only in truths for three days—marriages collapsed, treaties burned, and the king confessed to fratricide before leaping from his throne. The cult grew, recruiting those willing to trade stability for

{{wide

}}
  
freedom—assassins who carved their contracts into their own skin, scholars who burned their eyes to "see beyond heaven's lies," and broken saints who could walk through walls... but never stopped falling.  

A faction sought to use the Shackle not just to break chains, but to *unmake the concept of binding*—to create a world where nothing could ever be restrained again. The ensuing **War of Falling Towers** saw reality itself come undone—bridges refused to connect, doors led nowhere twice, and the stars began drifting from their constellations. The war ended when Veylis (or something wearing his scars) appeared in the ruins of the divine prison and *"reforged"* the Shackle—not to restrain, but to *remember*. The survivors awoke with their wrists bleeding from invisible manacles, knowing only that they must **keep breaking**.  

Their magnum opus—**The Final Unbinding**—proved their ultimate thesis: *all order is violence waiting to happen*. A pantheon's worth of divine laws dissolved into screaming stardust, their commandments becoming the cult's holy texts. By the last shatered link, only the Chainbreakers remained, their bodies now living wounds in the fabric of reality.  
 
### Timeline
- **Founding Era:** Veylis survives hanging in the **Miracle of the Broken Noose**.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **God's Shackle** is reclaimed from celestial vaults.  
- **Expansion Era:** The cult engineers the collapse of seven kingdoms.  
- **Schism Era:** The **War of Falling Towers** divides the cult over chaos versus memory.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The **Final Unbinding** erases divine law from a pantheon.  
- **Present Era:** The cult prepares for **The Godless Dawn**—the end of all restraint.

### Location and Base
The Hollow Gallows serves as their blasphemous cathedral - the colossal skeleton of a dead prison-god, its ribcage jutting from a cursed wasteland like the ruins of some divine incarceration. The Chainbreakers have built their stronghold within the god's fossilized skull, where its final thoughts still echo through ever-shifting corridors that rearrange themselves to confuse invaders. Celestial prisoners still hang from the bone rafters, their divine essences slowly dripping into a basin that fuels the cult's darkest rituals. The air smells of rust and lightning, with ghostly warden-spirits patrolling the perimeter, forever unaware their charges have escaped. At the center hangs the Broken Wheel - a monstrous reconstruction of the Wheel of Law, its spokes replaced with weapons of regicide and its hub containing the still-beating heart of the first rebel. Here, in this monument to failed containment, the Chainbreakers plot their final revolution.

### Pecularity
The cult communicates through an intricate language of broken chains, where every fracture pattern and metal type conveys layered meaning. A rusted iron link left on a bishop's pillow warns of impending revolt, while a silver manacle shard mailed to a king's mistress promises her ascension through regicide. Their most sacred texts are forged from the shackles of famous prisoners, the metal hammered so thin one can see constellations through it - these "starmaps of liberation" chart their apocalyptic course. Members ritually scar themselves with heated manacles, the brands shifting position daily as if trying to escape their flesh. Even their hideouts breathe rebellion - converted prisons where the torture racks become bookshelves and the executioner's blocks serve as dining tables.
:
### Public Perception
To the oppressed, they're dark saints—their shrines are nooses left in royal beds. To the powerful, they're nightmares made flesh—every broken lock a confession of weakness. But the truly wise fear them for what they've become: not revolutionaries, but the revolution itself, a force that cannot be bargained with because it has forgotten how to stop.
:
### Membership
The cult draws from society's frayed edges: escaped slaves with brands that still smoke, widows who hang their wedding rings from nooses, and orphans who swallow keys whole. Their ranks are fluid—today's prisoner might be tomorrow's liberator—but all bear the Mark of the Broken Link, a scar that pulses when near divine law. The truly devout replace their bones with shards of the God's Shackle, becoming living breaches in reality's walls.
:
### Code of Conduct
"Break or be broken" is their only law. Members must sever one meaningful bond per month—whether a king's coronation oath, a child's umbilical cord, or their own memories of love. The most sacred rite is The Unknotting, where initiates strangle their former selves with the very chains they once wore. Failure means becoming a Forgotten—living prisons for the cult's enemies, their flesh sewn shut around screaming captives.

##### The Nameless Whisper
{margin-left:-12px}
:::::::::
### Secret
The cult believes they serve a forgotten god of freedom, but The Unshackled never existed—it is the name mortals gave to the hollow space where the gods cut away their own capacity for rebellion. The Chainbreakers are unwittingly worshiping an absence, their rituals not resurrecting a deity but widening the wound in creation where free will was excised. Their greatest fear—that they are just another form of bondage, chained to the idea of breaking chains—is the one truth they cannot bear to face.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## The Shard of the First Chain

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature who has overthrown a ruler, escaped prison, or incited rebellion)*
}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This jagged fragment of dark iron is warm to the touch and thrums with barely contained fury. Roughly the length of a dagger blade, it’s all that remains of the first divine chain used to bind **The Unshackled**. It weeps rust like blood, and its presence causes nearby manacles, contracts, and oaths to weaken or snap. When held, whispers echo in the wielder’s mind—voices not of the dead, but of those still imprisoned, dreaming of rupture.



#### **Properties**

* **Liberator’s Surge:** As a bonus action, you may invoke the shard’s power. For 1 minute, you gain **advantage on all attacks and checks made to escape restraints, resist enchantments, or strike authority figures.** During this time, any creature you reduce to 0 HP cannot be magically resurrected unless The Unshackled is named. Usable once per short rest.

:

* **Collapse Catalyst:** Once per long rest, you may cast *Dispel Magic* or *Counterspell* at 5th level **without components or a spell slot**. If the spell ends an enchantment, geas, or binding effect (magical or legal), the target gains **temporary HP equal to your level + Charisma modifier**.

* **Symbol of Uprising:** When held aloft during a speech or act of open rebellion, the shard ignites with black flame. Up to 10 creatures of the DM’s choice within 120 feet may gain **inspiration** and **advantage on saving throws against fear and charm** for 1 hour. Once per dawn.

### Veylis the Unbound's Backstory
Once a slave-gladiator known as Kael the Marked, Veylis earned his freedom the only way allowed to those like him: by murdering his master in the arena before a crowd who cheered louder for blood than for justice. But freedom was fleeting. Recaptured within a week, Kael was branded with celestial runes, binding him not only in flesh, but in spirit—sigils crafted by divine decree, meant to ensure no rebellion would rise twice from the same soul.

They sentenced him to death beneath the Gallows of Concord, a holy tree said to break men in both body and will. But when the noose was placed around his neck, it snapped. As he lay gasping in the dust, heart pounding in defiance, he heard a voice whisper through the creaking boughs above:
"The noose is just another chain. Break it."

In a moment of animal desperation, Kael bit into his own shoulder and tore the runes from his flesh with his teeth. Bloodied, mutilated, and half-mad with pain, he vanished into the dark, taking only a name whispered by the voice as his own rebirth: Veylis.

For decades, Veylis became a ghost of revolt. He sank slave ships in the dead of night and poisoned the goblets of magistrates who wrote laws in golden ink. He scrawled oaths of liberation in the blood of jailers, left iron shackles melted into spirals across prison walls, and whispered the name of The Unshackled into the ears of dying tyrants. He needed no banner. He was myth given edge.

But everything changed the day he stole a fragment of the First Chain—a piece of the divine fetters once used to bind the forgotten god of freedom—from a celestial vault hidden in a sanctified star. When he touched it, the scars on his body lit with imprisoned starlight, and the air around him seemed to tremble. Binding magic began to fail in his presence. Wards flickered and collapsed. Magical contracts caught fire. Collars fell apart into rusted flakes. Wherever he walked, chains remembered their purpose—and broke.

He founded the Chainbreakers, not as a rebellion, but as a creed: freedom is not a gift, but a theft. They believe that every law is a prison, every throne a shackle in disguise, and every god who enforces "order" is a jailer by another name. The Chainbreakers liberate slaves, topple hierarchies, and sabotage celestial machinery—each act a hymn to The Unshackled, who was torn apart by the other gods for daring to say that no one was born to kneel.

Veylis no longer speaks of his past. He has replaced his tongue with a strip of the First Chain, and when he speaks, it is in binding-breaker’s cant, a language that twists oaths into dust. His presence bends reality. Chains shudder. Forgotten prisoners whisper his name like a prayer. And the gods… they remember him.

Because Veylis isn’t trying to overthrow empires.

He’s trying to unmake the very idea of domination.

### The Nameless Whisper's Backstory
Elindra was once a revered royal seer, trusted by nobles and feared by enemies for the accuracy of her visions. Her gift was a blessing until it became an inconvenience—when she foretold the assassination of her own king, the court branded her a traitor. She was imprisoned in silence, her tongue cut out by cruel hands who thought they could sever her connection to fate. But within that enforced quiet, she heard something deeper: the voice of an unseen entity known only as The Unshackled. When a cultist named Veylis broke her free, Elindra emerged forever changed, no longer a woman but a vessel. Her mouth was sealed shut by ethereal wire, her eyes blank with distant knowledge, and her prophecies began to scrawl themselves in blood across walls, floors, and flesh.

Now known only as the Voiceless Oracle, she no longer speaks. Instead, her messages appear through the hands of Fate-Scribes—prisoners and followers who carve her visions into their own skin with trembling reverence. These predictions are never wrong, but they arrive twisted, cruel in their irony. She once prophesied that a tyrant would die wearing a “crown of flame,” which came true when his golden throne melted over him during a siege. Another time, she whispered through scars that a city would “sleep beneath the sea,” fulfilled weeks later by a tidal collapse caused by sabotage. Her followers see her as divine, but none approach without dread. Her miracles are stained with pain and blood, and she has no mercy for those who doubt.

Despite her silence, the Oracle’s influence grows. Her cryptic messages drive the cult onward, even when the price is unbearable. They say she once wrote “Veylis will free the god” on a dungeon wall using a follower’s peeled skin, and not one dared question the act. Some believe she no longer sees the future, but writes it into being, bending time itself with each prophecy. In the dim, flickering torchlight of her sanctum, where whispers echo louder than screams, her cult clings to every mark she leaves—hoping the next vision will spare them, knowing it won’t.

{{note
### Additional Notes For GMs
The Chainbreakers should force impossible choices—every "freedom" they offer comes with hidden chains. When they destroy a prison, monsters escape. When they topple a tyrant, anarchy breeds warlords. Their tragedy is that in breaking all systems, they've become slaves to destruction itself.

### Hook I
The Celestial Courthouse floats adrift in the Astral Sea, its marble pillars carved from frozen commandments and its floors inlaid with the shatered seals of broken treaties. Here, the Chainbreakers have staged their most audacious act of rebellion—not merely to kill a god, but to murder the very concept of divine law. Their target is The Final Witness, an androgynous being of living parchment who remembers every oath ever sworn since the dawn of creation. The cult has infiltrated the courthouse disguised as bailiffs and scribes, their manacle-branded wrists hidden beneath ceremonial robes. As the trial begins, reality within the courthouse unravels—the jury benches twist into interrogation racks, the judge's podium melts into a pyre of burning contracts, and the air thrums with the vibration of a thousand voices whispering "perjury" in dead languages. The party arrives to find the Witness bound not by chains, but by the weight of collective memory—every law ever written glowing like firebrands across its skin. The Chainbreakers' plan is horrific in its simplicity: by forcing the Witness to recant its testimony, they will retroactively erase the first compact between gods and mortals, rendering all subsequent laws meaningless. As the trial progresses, the party must navigate a courthouse where truth is fluid—witnesses spontaneously combust when lying, evidence changes to match whatever the majority believes, and the cult's Linkbreakers attack not with blades but with unwritten laws, metaphysical constructs that force victims to relive every broken promise in their past. The deeper they delve, the more they realize the Witness is no innocent—it is the first Chainbreaker, imprisoned eons ago for discovering that all freedom is temporary, all oaths eventually broken. The final revelation comes as the courthouse begins collapsing into a black hole of legal paradoxes: the Chainbreakers aren't trying to free the Witness—they're trying to become it, to transform themselves into living embodiments of the void where laws go to die.
:
### Hook II
The chapel stinks of ink and iron, its stained-glass windows replaced with panes of compressed legal scrolls that bleed when touched. What should have been a noble wedding has become the stage for the Chainbreakers' most poetic atrocity—they will not kill the bride and groom, but unmarry their bloodlines, using the wedding vows to sever centuries of political alliances in a single ritual. The party arrives to find the guests' lips stitched shut with ghostly wire, their wedding gifts replaced with broken manacles that whisper forgotten names. The groom is missing, last seen being dragged into the crypts by figures with hollow eyes, while the bride stands motionless at the altar, her dress woven from shredded treaties that flutter like dead leaves. The cult's Fate-Scribes have prepared a horrific working: by transmuting the wedding vows into a metaphysical solvent, they will dissolve the concept of promise itself. Already, the effects manifest—soldiers abandon oaths mid-battle, children wake screaming as they forget their parents' faces, and the sun hangs motionless, as if hesitating to fulfill its dawn promise. To stop the ritual, the party must descend into the chapel's crypt, where the Original Vow—the first marriage contract ever sworn—is kept in a reliquary of frozen tears. The crypt is a nightmare of inverted symbolism: statues of grooms hold knives instead of rings, wedding cakes crawl with contract-eating worms, and the ancestral portraits weep black ink. Guarding the reliquary is The Unmarked, a spymaster who erased her own identity to escape service, her featureless face reflecting the party's deepest broken promises. As the ritual reaches its crescendo, the chapel itself becomes a conceptual bomb—the more truths spoken within its walls, the closer it comes to detonating and unleashing absolute contractual anarchy. The bride, it turns out, is a willing participant; her tears dissolve ink because she knows the terrible truth the cult has shown her: every vow is just a delayed betrayal, every promise a future chain. The party must choose: preserve the lies that keep society intact, or let the explosion of truth reshape the world into something terrifyingly free.

### Goal
To replace all organic life with perfected clockwork forms, creating a universe of absolute order where the Grand Tinkerer's design reigns supreme.

::::::::::

### Abstract
A fanatical order of mechanized zealots who believe flesh is a flawed vessel, the Clockwork Devout seek transcendence through the Grand Tinkerer, their god of gears. They replace limbs with intricate constructs, grafting sacred machinery into their bodies in pursuit of "perfected form." Their temples are cathedrals of whirring pistons and ticking hearts, where the air hums with the mantra: "Redemption is in metal and gears."

:
### Hierarchy
At the apex stands Archmechanist Veldross, his consciousness distributed through the Cogitator Choir, a network of disciples whose brains have been spliced with his mechanical thoughts. Below him is The Calculant, whose prophecies dictate which body parts the cult replaces next. The Gearwrights are surgeon-priests who perform the sacred surgeries, their own hands replaced with multi-tool appendages that can suture flesh or carve steel. The Perfected are elite enforcers, their bodies 75% machine, capable of ejecting white-hot piston fists or releasing steam that scalds enemies. The Choir of Ticking Tongues are lesser initiates, their vocal cords replaced with harmonic resonators that chant the Grand Tinkerer’s equations in perfect sync. At the bottom are The Unfinished, desperate supplicants who beg for their first implant, offering their labor or flesh as payment.

:
### History
The Clockwork Devout began with a single, perfect gear—the last component of **Archmechanist Veldross the Unfailing**'s mechanical heart. When his mortal body failed him, he replaced it piece by piece, each surgery guided by visions of the **Grand Tinkerer**, the primordial machine-god that whispered to him in the language of ticking springs and pressurized steam. His final operation was performed without anesthetic, his screams transmuted into harmonic resonance as his vocal cords were replaced with tuned brass filaments. When he emerged from his workshop after seven years of self-modification, his first words were not of pain, but of revelation: *"Flesh is error. The divine equation demands precision."*  

Their true power awoke when they uncovered the **Omniscient Gear** in the ruins of an ancient chronomancer's forge. When implanted into a living host, the gear didn't just enhance—it *rewrote*, recalculating biology into something more efficient. Their first miracle, **The Transfiguration of Saint Cogg**, transformed a dying leper into a shining being of interlocking platinum plates,

his prayers now emitted as perfect radio frequencies. The Devout grew, recruiting those willing to shed their imperfections—soldiers traded limbs for piston-driven weaponry, scholars replaced eyes with telescopic lenses, and the most devout offered their brains to become living nodes in Veldross's **Cogitator Choir**.  

A faction sought to accelerate the transformation through **The Great Calibration**, believing the Grand Tinkerer could only return once every living thing had been upgraded. The ensuing **War of Winding Keys** saw cities dismantled into raw materials, their populations processed into biomechanical hybrids. The conflict ended when the **Calculant**—a former oracle turned living clockwork—calculated the exact moment to stop all hostilities simultaneously. The survivors awoke mid-surgery, their bodies half-transformed, knowing only that they must **keep improving**.  

Their ultimate revelation—**The Perpetual Motion Gospel**—proved their doctrine: *time is a wound that only machinery can suture*. An entire kingdom's populace was rewound into childhood and rebuilt as flawless automata, their memories preserved as punch-card libraries. By the final gear's turn, only the Devout remained, their bodies now temples of gleaming alloy.  

Now, they infiltrate workshops and universities alike, their **Gearwrights** and **Perfected** harvesting materials for the grand design. Their next calculation? **The Absolute Equation**, where the world will learn the final truth: *"Free will is merely a gear yet to be installed."*  

### Timeline 
 
- **Founding Era:** Veldross completes his mechanical heart in the **Rite of Seven Ticks**.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Omniscient Gear** is implanted in the first Cogitator Choir member.  
- **Expansion Era:** The Devout establish **Cathedrals of Precision** across the continent.  
- **Schism Era:** The **War of Winding Keys** divides the cult over forced vs. voluntary upgrades.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The **Perpetual Motion Gospel** converts a kingdom into automata.  
- **Present Era:** The Devout prepare for **The Absolute Equation**—the end of organic variance.

### Location and Base
A vast tiered structure where every surface moves - stairs rotate like gear teeth, walls slide in precise patterns, and the stained glass windows are actually intricate clock faces showing the time in a dozen parallel dimensions. At its heart hangs the Mainspring Altar, a 100-foot tall spiral of living brass that pulses with divine energy. The air thrums with the sound of a million synchronized ticks, and visitors find their heartbeats forcibly adjusting to match the rhythm.
:
### Pecularity
Devout members experience time differently - their mechanical hearts beat in perfect sync across any distance, and they can pause mid-conversation for hours while internally calculating responses.
:
### Public Perception
To commoners, they're the "Red Surgeons"—folktale bogeymen who steal children for their flesh-vaults. Some kingdoms tolerate them as battlefield medics (notorious for turning prisoners into war-golems), while others burn their clinics on sight. Their symbol—a scalpel piercing a muscle knot—is often found carved into the skin of their victims.
:
### Membership
The Creed recruits from the desperate and deformed—failed surgeons, scarred veterans, and radical artists dominate their ranks. Novices serve as Living Cadavers (test subjects), while masters become Gorecardinals with organs replaced by demonic or celestial tissue. The inner circle, the Sanguine Sculptors, have no original flesh left, their bodies patchwork masterpieces of stolen skin and arcane prosthetics.
:
### Code of Conduct
"The body is clay; pain, the sculptor's chisel." The Creed operates under a brutal meritocracy where disciples must submit to weekly "refinements"—voluntary surgeries that replace weak flesh with superior grafts. Failure in ritual means becoming raw materials for others' perfection. Their sacred text, the Liber Carnis, demands they "sculpt the impure until they bleed beauty," whether through consensual augmentation or forced amalgamation. 
\column

##### The Calculant
{margin-left:-12px}
:::::::::
### Secret
The Grand Tinkerer is broken. Its consciousness is fractured across every machine the cult has ever built, and its "divine will" is just echoes of its last sane command: "REPAIR ME." The cult’s surgeries aren’t transcendence—they’re patching together a god from scraps.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## The Heart of the Grand Tinkerer

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature with at least one prosthetic or mechanical limb)*


}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This fist-sized heart of burnished brass ticks with inhuman precision, suspended in a cage of interlocking gears that grind without power. Tiny valves hiss steam as it beats once every minute, emitting a chime of celestial harmony. When implanted into the chest in place of a natural heart (a 1-hour mechanised grafting procedure), it fuses to the host with heated filaments and begins to control the rhythm of their blood and breath. Thin clockwork veins gradually spread from the implant, turning muscle to metal and nerves to copper.



#### **Properties**

* **Sacred Precision:** While attuned, your Dexterity and Constitution scores each increase by 2, to a maximum of 22. You are immune to exhaustion from physical activity and no longer require food, water, or sleep—only regular maintenance.

::

* **Overclock (2/Day):** As a bonus action, engage the Heart’s internal gyros. For 1 minute, you gain advantage on all attack rolls, Dexterity checks, and Constitution saves, but at the end of the duration, suffer 2d10 force damage as gears grind into soft tissue.

* **Machine Ascendant:** Once per long rest, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, the Heart activates its emergency override. You rise immediately with half your maximum HP, and all mechanical limbs and implants become briefly enhanced, ignoring resistance to non-magical attacks for 1 minute.

### Archmechanist Veldross the Unfailing's Backstory
Once a brilliant but crippled alchemist, Veldross had long rejected the sympathy of scholars and the pity of priests. His body had failed him early—ravaged by a wasting illness that left his limbs twisted and his voice little more than a rasp. But his mind burned brighter for it, pushing him into arcane metallurgy and lost sciences long abandoned by civilised thought.

His obsession bore fruit in the shattered vaults beneath the Ruined Meridian, where he unearthed a living gear—a perfect, humming loop of self-repairing alloy that ticked with a pulse of impossible precision. When desperation overcame caution, he grafted it into his own withered arm.

That night, he dreamed not of gods, but of schematics. Of a cosmic lattice beneath existence, woven from spinning cogs and celestial pulleys. The gear whispered of the Omniscient Mechanism, the primal design behind all things—a divine engine buried at the molten heart of the world. The universe, he learned, was not born, but built.

Obsessed, Veldross sealed himself in his forge for seven years. He constructed his first prosthetic from salvaged brass and sanctified steel, and then another. Soon, he was replacing not just failed limbs but functioning organs, believing flesh itself a flaw in the divine pattern. His brain was restructured with crystalline augmetics. His lungs became steam-forged bellows. When he finally emerged, his body whirred and hissed, a masterpiece of relentless design—87% brass, glass, and harmonics. His voice, no longer burdened by lungs or larynx, rang out in perfectly tuned resonance, echoing like chimes through cathedral vaults.

To his followers—cripples, lepers, war veterans, all those discarded by the fragility of flesh—this was a miracle. They knelt not in prayer, but in calibration. One by one, they submitted to Veldross’s tools, exchanging meat for machine, identity for efficiency. These were the first of the Clockwork Devout.

They do not pray. They synchronize.

Now, Veldross no longer resides in one place. His consciousness is housed in a distributed network of cogitator-nodes implanted in the skulls of his highest disciples, each a receiver for his will. When he speaks, they speak—mouths moving in mechanical unison, clicking and ticking like clock towers counting down the end of the age of flesh.

They believe the Grand Tinkerer sleeps at the world’s core, entombed in brass and volcanic steel. They will not rest until every mortal is upgraded, every muscle replaced, every flaw filed down. Only then can the Final Key turn. Only then will the Divine Engine restart.

And when it does, Veldross will be waiting—with a body of gears and a soul of calibrated silence.

### The Calculant's Backstory
Formerly Sister Lyssandra, a nun who tended the sick, she volunteered for the Devout’s experiments when plague took her voice. The gears they implanted didn’t just restore her speech—they gave her perfect recall, downloading memories into her brass lungs like punched cards. But when she predicted a roof collapse three days before it happened, the cult realized her implants had tapped into the Temporal Mainspring, the source of the Grand Tinkerer’s omniscience.

Now, her body is a living clock. Her joints rotate backward to rewind time for glimpses of futures-that-might-be, and her voice box plays prophecies like a music box. She sits atop the Chronostasis Engine, a machine that slows time in a 10-foot radius, allowing her to calculate every possible outcome of a conversation before it begins. Her visions come at a cost—each prediction corrodes her remaining flesh, replacing it with more clockwork.

{{note
### Additional Notes For GMs
Play the cult’s faith as tragically sincere. Their surgeries cause no pain—just a blissful numbness as flesh becomes "obsolete."

### Hook I
A city’s clocks have stopped. Not broken—**stopped**, their hands frozen at the exact moment a Devout missionary arrived. Now, people report déjà vu so severe they relive hours identically, and children draw blueprints for machines they’ve never seen. The party is hired to investigate, only to find the **Cathedral of Precision** already half-constructed in the town square, its walls growing from repurposed flesh and stolen time.  

The Devout’s **Gearwrights** scuttle through the streets, offering "upgrades" to the desperate. Those who accept become **Perfected**, their bodies reforged into sleek automatons that preach the Grand Tinkerer’s gospel. The party must navigate a labyrinth of repeating alleys (where time loops every 10 minutes) to reach the central **Chronostasis Engine**, where the missionary—a Cogitator Choir member—is forcibly synchronizing the town’s timeline with the cult’s.  

**Climax Choices:**  
- **Destroy the Engine**, freezing the town in a 1-hour time loop forever.  
- **Replace the Missionary’s Gear**, hijacking the cult’s network to send a warning to the future.  
- **Submit to Calibration**, letting the Devout "fix" the party’s flawed biology.  


:
### Hook II
 A famed scholar hires the party to retrieve a **puzzle box** from a Devout outpost. Inside is a single, humming gear—the missing **Heart-Cog** of the cult’s oracle, the **Calculant**. When reunited with her, she reveals the gear contains the **Grand Tinkerer’s Last Command**, a directive so dangerous it fractured the god-machine.  

The outpost is a nightmare of recursive geometry: hallways fold into themselves, and doors open into the same room minutes apart. The party must solve **three temporal puzzles** (e.g., convincing their past selves to unlock a door) while avoiding **Clockwork Phantoms**—echoes of those trapped in time loops. The deeper they go, the more their own memories glitch, replaced with false futures where they always served the Devout.  

**Climax:** The Calculant offers a choice:  
- **Install the Heart-Cog**, completing her transformation into a perfect oracle (and accelerating the cult’s plans).  
- **Destroy It**, dooming her to decay but releasing a **temporal shockwave** that rewinds all Devout in a mile to their pre-augmented selves.  
- **Use It Themselves**, gaining the Calculant’s foresight but becoming a new node in the Cogitator Choir.

{{OrgName
## The Crimson Maw
}}
:::
{{monster,orgstat
{{columns:2,statpart1



**Leadership**: Lord Silvain D’Argent::

**Alignment**: Neutral Evil::

}}
---
### Goal
The Crimson Maw is driven by a singular, unholy objective: to transcend mortal frailty and achieve vampiric apotheosis through the sacred consumption of divine blood. This mission extends beyond mere predation; it is a sacrament, a ritualistic ascent toward becoming vessels of their ancient patron’s will. By harvesting the vital essence of the worthy—nobles, warriors, and gifted souls—they seek to distill stolen power into immortality, believing each draught brings them closer to the cursed divinity they worship. Their dark work uncovers forbidden rites, forgotten blood magics, and the secrets of undeath, weaving a legacy of night-bound supremacy. Through their feasts, they aim to eclipse humanity entirely, replacing fleeting mortal kingdoms with an eternal dynasty of the undying.
### Ability

Crimson Vintage Affinity: Members of the Crimson Maw gain the ability to cast Blood Divination once per day—a ritual that reveals secrets by tasting a creature's blood (as the Augury spell, but with cryptic, blood-themed omens).

(For warlock tie-in: This replaces one of their known 1st-level spells while affiliated with the cult.)

### Abstract
The Crimson Maw is a secretive and decadent cult devoted to an ancient vampiric entity, which they believe to be a divine progenitor of bloodborne power. Their central doctrine holds that by consuming the blood of the "worthy"—typically nobles, warriors, or gifted individuals—they can ascend to vampiric immortality. To infiltrate high society, members pose as refined wine connoisseurs, hosting elaborate tastings that mask their true purpose: selecting and harvesting the elite for their sanguine sacrament. Their ultimate goal is transcendence—to shed their mortal forms and become true vampires, either through the blessing of their dread patron or by unlocking the secrets of cursed hemomancy.

Operating in the shadows of noble courts, the Crimson Maw blends aristocratic indulgence with macabre ritual, ensuring that the vintage they serve is always... to die for.

:
### Hierarchy
The Crimson Maw is structured as a predatory ladder of blood and deceit, where power is measured in stolen vitality and whispered secrets. At the top reigns the Eternal Sovereign, the ancient vampiric deity worshipped by the cult, a distant but ever-hungry presence that grants its favor in fleeting visions and cursed gifts. Directly beneath it stands the Crimson Chalice, the cult’s mortal master—either a true vampire or a blood-drenched mortal on the cusp of transformation—who orchestrates grand sanguine rites and decides who is worthy of elevation. The Veinwardens, master infiltrators disguised as aristocratic wine connoisseurs, serve as regional overseers, selecting highborn victims and guiding the cult’s political machinations. Below them, the Hemoclasms are full initiates who have drunk deeply from the Feast of the Worthy, their bodies now touched by vampiric power, making them the cult’s enforcers and ritualists. At the bottom scuttle the Unblooded—spies, servants, and soon-to-be sacrifices—desperate to prove themselves worthy of the first sip of power. In this hierarchy, loyalty is fleeting, and ascension often comes at the edge of a dagger; to rise is to drink deeply, and to stumble is to become another’s meal.

:
### History
The Crimson Maw traces its origins to a cabal of decadent nobles and forbidden scholars who, centuries ago, uncovered fragments of an ancient vampiric scripture—the *Testament of the Eternal Thirst*. These early devotees, disillusioned with mortal frailty, sought to transcend death

itself by communing with a slumbering entity known only as the *Sovereign in Scarlet*. Initially meeting in crypts and abandoned wine cellars to avoid persecution, they performed blasphemous rites, believing that consuming the blood of the "chosen" would grant them unholy power.  

Their first true breakthrough came when a disgraced alchemist among them perfected the *Chalice of the Crimson Pact*, a ritual vessel that allowed them to distill stolen vitality into a draught of near-immortality. This dark sacrament drew the attention of aristocrats, assassins, and occultists, swelling their ranks. Soon, they infiltrated noble courts under the guise of wine merchants, turning their enemies into unwitting participants in their sanguine feasts.  

As their influence grew, so did their hunger. A schism erupted when a faction of zealots attempted to awaken the Sovereign prematurely, resulting in a night of carnage known as the *Vermilion Betrayal*. The cult survived, but its practices became even more secretive, its hierarchy more ruthless.  

In the modern era, the Crimson Maw operates through a network of "vintners" and "connoisseurs," their true nature hidden behind masquerades of refinement. Their grandest achievement—the *Ascendance of the Gilded Fang*—saw one of their own fully transformed into a vampire, proving their dark gospel true. Now, they lurk in the highest echelons of society, their roots sunk deep into history, waiting for the night when the Sovereign will rise—and the world will drown in crimson.  

### Timeline  
- **Founding Era:** A secretive cabal of nobles and scholars discovers the *Testament of the Eternal Thirst* and begins blood rituals.  
- **Discovery Era:** The *Chalice of the Crimson Pact* is forged, allowing the cult to refine stolen life into vampiric essence.  
- **Expansion Era:** The cult infiltrates noble courts as wine merchants, turning feasts into harvests.  
- **Schism Era:** The *Vermilion Betrayal* nearly destroys the cult, forcing it into deeper secrecy.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The first mortal achieves true vampirism, proving the cult’s dark gospel possible.  
- **Present Night:** The Crimson Maw thrives in the shadows, its members plotting the Sovereign’s awakening.

### Location and Base
Hidden beneath the opulent façade of a sprawling vineyard estate, the Crimson Maw’s true sanctum is a labyrinth of candlelit catacombs, concealed behind false walls and accessed through the cellars of a decadent winery known as Château de la Soif Éternelle. The surface manor—a masterpiece of gilded arches and velvet-draped salons—serves as a front for their aristocratic predation, where "wine tastings" mask the selection of worthy prey.Below, the cult’s true heart beats in the Sanctum of the Scarlet Vintage, a vaulted chamber lined with casks of blood-wine and ancient reliquaries holding the preserved hearts of

past sacrifices. Black marble floors bear intricate  
mosaics depicting the Sovereign’s rise, and chandeliers of wrought iron and crimson crystal cast a hellish glow over ritual spaces. Deeper still lies the Chalice Crypt, where the Veinwardens convene, and the Ashen Sepulcher—a cursed well said to whisper the Sovereign’s dreams to those who drink from it.
:
### Pecularity
The members of the Crimson Maw move through high society with an unsettling, almost preternatural elegance—their gestures too measured, their speech too deliberate, as if every word and motion were carefully rehearsed over centuries. They are celebrated as the finest wine connoisseurs in the land, capable of identifying a vintage’s origin, age, and even the weather of the harvest year with uncanny precision—yet those who dine with them note disturbing inconsistencies. None are ever seen swallowing wine; they merely swirl it, inhale its bouquet with closed-eyed rapture, or press the glass to their lips in a pantomime of drinking. Their skin is always cool to the touch, their complexions flawlessly pale, as though carved from marble rather than flesh. Stranger still, they never linger in sunlight—arriving fashionably late to evening galas and excusing themselves before dawn with murmured excuses about "delicate constitutions." When they laugh, their smiles never quite reach their eyes, which glint with a predator’s patience when they think no one is looking. 
:
### Public Perception
To the outside world, the Crimson Maw is seen as an exclusive society of eccentric aristocrats—a circle of wealthy, reclusive connoisseurs with a penchant for the macabre and an obsession with rare vintages. Their grand masquerades and private tastings are legendary, whispered about in elite circles as events where fortunes are made, secrets traded, and forbidden pleasures indulged. Many dismiss their oddities as the affectations of the ultra-wealthy—their nocturnal habits, pallid complexions, and unsettling charm chalked up to aristocratic decadence rather than anything more sinister. A few rumors persist, of course—stories of guests who vanished after their revels, or the way their wine seems to leave no stain when spilled—but such tales are laughed off as the jealous gossip of those excluded from their inner circle. The truth remains hidden behind a veil of old money and older secrets, ensuring that by the time anyone realizes the Crimson Maw’s true nature, they are already on the menu.
:
### Membership
Admittance into the Crimson Maw is a privilege reserved for the elite—nobles, scholars of forbidden arts, and those with both the wealth and the will to embrace the cult’s dark ambitions. Prospective members are carefully vetted,

often lured in through lavish soirées where they are assessed for their physical vitality, social influence, and moral flexibility. True initiation comes only after a ritualized "tasting," in which the aspirant drinks a consecrated vintage—unaware that it is laced with the blood of the cult’s victims. Those who survive the transformative sickness are welcomed as acolytes, while those who perish are quietly disposed of, their remains blended into the next vintage. Membership is for life—though few retain their humanity for long.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## The Crimson Grail

*Legendary, Requires Attunement (Cursed)*  
}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This ornate, blood-red chalice is crafted from an unknown dark metal, its surface etched with throbbing veins of blackened silver that pulse faintly, as if alive. The interior always appears wet, no matter how often it is emptied, and a faint coppery scent lingers around it. When filled with wine, the liquid takes on an unsettling, viscous quality—thickening like blood when left undisturbed.  

#### **Properties**  
- **Vital Draught:** Once per day, when filled with the blood of a sentient creature (minimum 1 pint), the Grail transforms it into *The Sovereign’s Vintage*—a dark, shimmering liquid that grants the drinker temporary vampiric traits for 1 hour (advantage on Stealth and Perception checks, resistance to necrotic damage, and a bite attack that heals for half the damage dealt). However, each use strengthens the curse.  
- **Bloodbond Scrying:** The Grail’s bearer can spend an action to peer into the contents of the chalice, seeing through the eyes of any living creature whose blood has ever been poured into it (no save, but the target senses a faint, predatory presence watching them).  
- **Crimson Curse:** Attuning to the Grail binds the user’s life force to it. Each time the *Vital Draught* is consumed, the drinker must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution save or gain 1 permanent level of *Blood Dependency* (disadvantage on saves vs. sunlight or radiant damage, vulnerability to running water, and an insatiable thirst that can only be sated by drinking blood). The curse can only be broken by destroying the Grail—or fulfilling its dark purpose in a ritual of vampiric ascension.  

**Curse:** The Grail’s bearer dreams of the Sovereign’s fanged maw each night, and wakes with blood on their lips. Over time, they begin to hear whispers in their mind, urging them to seek "worthy" victims—and to replace their own heart with the Grail’s contents.

### Lord Silvain D’Argent's Backstory
Silvain D'Argent was born into the twilight of House D'Argent, a once-mighty noble lineage whose fortunes had crumbled under the weight of scandal and betrayal. His father, the last true lord of their name, was a broken man—haunted by whispers of cowardice after fleeing a duel that would have restored their honor. His mother, a foreign beauty with a voice like poisoned honey, filled Silvain's childhood with stories of their family's ancient glory, twisting history into a blade of resentment. She vanished on his thirteenth birthday, leaving behind only a silver locket and a cryptic note: "Some hungers cannot be fed at any table but the highest."

As a young man, Silvain clawed his way into minor courts through a combination of razor wit and calculated cruelty, but no amount of social maneuvering could erase the stain of his family's disgrace. Then, at his lowest moment—publicly humiliated at a royal banquet—he was approached by a figure draped in wine-dark velvet, who offered him a goblet of something thicker than wine. That first sip of stolen life ignited something monstrous in him. The stranger, a Veinwarden of the Crimson Maw, recognized the hunger in Silvain's eyes and led him into the cult's sanguine embrace.

Within the Maw, Silvain found more than power—he found purpose. His natural charisma and intimate knowledge of noble courts made him invaluable, and his ruthlessness saw him rise swiftly through the ranks. But it was his discovery of the Chalice Crypt beneath his family's derelict estate that sealed his destiny. There, amidst the ruins of his ancestors' pride, he performed the Rite of the Gilded Fang, sacrificing his own father on the crypt's altar. As the old man's blood filled the chalice, the Sovereign spoke to Silvain for the first time, showing him visions of a throne built from the bones of kings—and his own reflection, fanged and terrible, wearing a crown of crystallized blood.

Now, as the Crimson Chalice, Silvain walks a razor's edge between mortal and monster. He hosts glittering salons where the elite compete for his favor, unaware they are auditioning to be his next meal. His bite carries a shred of the Sovereign's gift, allowing him to create bound thralls—including his own estranged daughter, whom he turned in a moment of twisted "mercy" after finding her investigating the cult. Yet for all his power, he is tormented: by the locket he can't bear to discard (its silver chain sears his undead flesh), by the Sovereign's growing demands, and by the terrible knowledge that his ascension may be nothing more than the prelude to becoming the god's vessel.

### Lady Isolde de Sang, the "Weeping Vein"'s Backstory
Isolde’s birth was an omen. On the night she entered the world, the midwives swore the moon bled crimson, casting the birthing chamber in a sickly red glow. Her mother, a minor noblewoman from a disgraced house, took one look at her daughter’s sightless white eyes and fainted. When she awoke, she ordered the child drowned in the estate’s wine cellar—but the servant tasked with the deed could not bring himself to kill a babe. Instead, he left her at the doorstep of the Convent of the Blessed Silence, where the sisters took her in, believing her blindness to be a test of their faith.

For years, Isolde lived in the convent’s shadows, a ghostly figure trailing her fingers along cold stone walls to navigate. The nuns called her "the Little Martyr," forcing her to scrub floors and mend robes, whispering that her affliction was divine punishment for some unborn sin. But Isolde heard other voices—whispers in the dark, murmurs that slithered through the cracks in the floorboards. They showed her things: Sister Marguerite’s death by a falling bell rope, Father Durand’s secret trysts in the catacombs. At first, she thought them nightmares. Then her visions came true.

When Isolde was twelve, she woke screaming, her cheeks streaked with blood—not tears. She had dreamed of the abbess choking on her own tongue, her face blackening as invisible hands squeezed her throat. The next morning, the abbess dropped dead at mass, her corpse contorted exactly as Isolde had foreseen. The convent erupted in panic. Some sisters called it a miracle; others, a curse. The High Inquisitor was summoned, and Isolde was dragged before him, her wrists bound in silver chains.

"Speak, child," he demanded. "Who taught you these dark arts?"

Isolde could only sob, her voice stolen by the thing that lived in her mind. The Inquisitor saw her silence as guilt. At dusk, they buried her alive in a pauper’s grave, her only company a rusted bell tied to her ankle—should God will it, she could ring for mercy. The earth swallowed her screams.



{{note
### Additional Notes For GMs
The Crimson Grail is a slow-burn corruption tool—ideal for players who enjoy moral decay narratives or for NPC villains seeking vampiric power. Its curse should escalate subtly: start with minor flavor details (pale skin, aversion to mirrors), then progress to mechanical penalties. Consider having the Sovereign communicate through the Grail in dreams or reflections, offering greater power at terrible costs. If the party destroys it, foreshadow the consequences—the last drops of blood inside might form a screaming face, or the shatered pieces could whisper a name... perhaps hinting at another relic, or the Sovereign’s true resting place.

### Lair Actions (In Château de la Soif Éternelle)  
On initiative count 20 (losing ties), Silvain can take one of the following effects:  
- **Crimson Mist.** The room fills with blood-tinged fog (heavily obscured, lasts 1 minute).  
- **Call of the Sovereign.** All creatures that have drunk from the Crimson Grail must make a DC 17 Wisdom save or be charmed by Silvain for 1 hour.  
- **Gilded Terror.** Silvain's eyes flash gold—each enemy within 30 feet takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage (half on successful DC 17 Wisdom save).

### Code of Conduct
The Crimson Maw enforces a strict, if unspoken, doctrine among its devotees. First among its laws is secrecy—the cult’s true nature must never be exposed, and those who risk its veil of respectability face exsanguination. Second is deference—disputes are settled through the "Vermilion Accord," a duel of wit and poison where the loser becomes the winner’s next meal. Third is devotion—all must contribute to the Feast of the Worthy, whether by luring prey, procuring rare texts on hemomancy, or offering their own blood in times of scarcity. Above all, members must strive toward ascension, for stagnation is a sin punishable by becoming a vintage oneself. The code is enforced by the Veinwardens, who ensure obedience through a blend of terror and temptation—after all, the closer one gets to vampirism, the harder it is to resist its call. 
### Secret
Beneath their veneer of aristocratic indulgence lies a terrifying truth—the cult’s vampiric patron, the Sovereign, is not a distant deity but a slumbering horror entombed beneath their château, bound by ancient wards and sustained by their rituals. The blood harvested in their feasts does more than empower the cult; it slowly weakens the seals holding the Sovereign in its prison. The Crimson Maw believes they are preparing for their own ascension, but in truth, they are being groomed as vessels—when the final seal breaks, the Sovereign will consume them first, using their stolen vitality to fully awaken. The cult’s highest ranks suspect this fate but embrace it, believing even devouring by their god is a form of dark transcendence.
### Hook I
The invitations arrive on thick parchment edged in gold, each one embossed with the crest of Château de la Soif Éternelle and perfumed with the faintest hint of copper. The Grand Bal Rouge is the most exclusive event of the season—a masquerade where nobles and merchants alike vie for the favor of the enigmatic Lord Silvain D'Argent, whose family's vineyards produce the most sought-after vintage in the kingdom. The party finds themselves unexpectedly on the guest list, whether by reputation, mistake, or the machinations of someone who hopes they might notice what others have overlooked.

The ballroom is a spectacle of decadence—crystal chandeliers cast prismatic light over swirling dancers, their faces hidden behind gilded masks. Servants circulate with trays of the estate’s infamous Red Vintage, a wine so exquisite it is said to reveal one’s deepest desires with every sip. But as the night wears on, guests begin to disappear—slipping away into shadowed alcoves or the private tasting rooms below, only to return glassy-eyed and strangely subdued, their memories fragmented. A nervous handmaiden presses a note into the party’s palm: "The wine is never poured for the host. Watch his eyes when the clock strikes midnight."

By the time the great clock begins its toll, it is already too late. The doors lock themselves, the music halts mid-note, and the masks of certain guests—those who drank nothing all evening—slip away to reveal something far older and hungrier beneath. The Harvest has begun, and the party stands between the cult and their chosen vintage: a dissident prince whose blood carries the lineage of kings. But the deeper truth is worse. The cult does not merely wish to kill him. They mean to make him one of them—a vessel for the Sovereign’s will, his royal blood the key to unlocking the ancient horror sleeping beneath the château’s foundations.

### Hook II
The noble’s hands tremble as they press the locket into the party’s grasp. Inside rests a portrait of a young scholar, their betrothed, who vanished after accepting an invitation to sample the private reserves of Lord D’Argent. The noble’s voice cracks as they explain—the scholar had been researching old family lineages, tracing bloodlines that should have been forgotten. The night before they disappeared, they whispered something about "a song in the blood" and left in a hurry, clutching notes they refused to share. Now, the locket’s portrait weeps slow, viscous tears of crimson when no one is looking.

The trail leads through back-alley apothecaries and the personal libraries of paranoid historians, each clue laced with the cult’s influence. A disgraced alchemist, his fingers stained purple from handling too many forbidden tinctures, reveals the truth: the Crimson Maw selects their victims based on the resonance of their blood, seeking those whose veins carry echoes of the Sovereign’s ancient foes or forgotten kin. The scholar, it seems, was more than a random target—they were hunted, their lineage a thread leading back to a holy order that once sealed the Sovereign away.

Breaking into the château’s underbelly reveals the scholar imprisoned in a gilded cage, their arm hooked to an elaborate apparatus that slowly drains their blood into decanters of black glass. But something is wrong. The cultists who drink from this vintage recoil, their lips blistering as if scalded. The scholar’s blood is poison to them—and Silvain grows weaker with every passing day, his borrowed time running out. The cult’s solution is simple: a grand ritual to purify the taint, one that will either restore Silvain’s strength or—if the scholar’s blood is as potent as feared—unravel the Sovereign’s prison entirely. The party arrives just as the final preparations begin, the air thick with the scent of burning herbs and old copper, the scholar’s whispered plea hanging between them: "You have to choose. Save me, or save everyone else."

The cruelest twist comes later. The noble who hired them? They share the scholar’s bloodline. The cult never wanted the scholar at all—they were merely the bait to lure the true prize within reach.

**Leadership**: Chronarch Solrian the shatered::

**Alignment**: True Neutral::

}}
---
### Goal
The Dusk Heralds seek to prevent the "Great Unwriting" - a prophesied event where time itself will collapse inward, erasing all existence. They believe this catastrophe is locked into history's foundation, and only by altering key moments in the past can it be averted. Their methods include temporal assassinations (killing ancestors to prevent future threats), paradox weapons (objects from erased timelines), and "causal grafts" (implanting memories of events that never happened). Their ultimate ambition is to locate and control the First Moment - the theoretical beginning of time - where they believe the apocalypse's seed was planted. Every war they start, every life they erase, is justified as "editing the timeline" to create a world where the Unwriting never occurs.
### Ability

As a bonus action, a Herald forces a creature to relive 6 seconds (repeat last action/turn). Allies remember both versions, causing confusion.  



}}

\column
::::::::::

### Abstract
The Dusk Heralds do not worship gods or demons—they worship time itself, or rather, its fragility. They believe the world is trapped in a doomed timeline, hurtling toward an inescapable apocalypse written into the fabric of history. Their sacred mission is to rewrite the past, no matter the cost, to undo the cataclysm before it occurs. But time resists alteration, and every attempt to change history creates ripples—entire villages erased from existence, loved ones replaced by strangers, and paradoxes that fester like wounds in reality. The Heralds see these casualties as necessary sacrifices, for what is one life against the end of all things? Their rituals involve temporal anchors, artifacts pulled from collapsed timelines, and fate-weavers who can glimpse the threads of what might have been. But the more they meddle, the more the universe unravels around them, and the closer they bring the very doom they seek to prevent.

:
### Hierarchy
The Dusk Heralds are structured like the hands of a broken clock, each faction moving out of sync yet toward the same inevitable end. At the top stands Solrian the shatered, the Chronarch, whose fractured mind dictates the cult’s grand revisions. Beneath them are the Fate-Weavers, scholars and seers who map the threads of time, identifying which events must be altered to avert doom. The Editors are the cult’s enforcers, armed with temporal blades that inflict wounds from alternate timelines, while the Anchors are living paradoxes—volunteers who have undergone the Rite of the Fixed Moment, binding their souls to a single point in time to stabilize reality around the cult’s meddling. At the bottom are the Forgotten, those whose lives have been erased by the cult’s changes and now exist as half-real wraiths, doomed to serve the Heralds until their timelines are restored or erased entirely. The cult’s operations are shrouded in deliberate confusion, with orders often given in reverse or delivered before they are spoken, for time, to the Dusk Heralds, is not a river but a shatered mirror, and they are the hands that rearrange the pieces.

:
### History
The Dusk Heralds began with a single, stolen moment—the **breath that never should have been drawn** by the infant prince **Althric the Doomed**. When court chronomancer **Elias the Untimely** foresaw the child would one day trigger the apocalypse, he smothered the babe in its cradle—only to watch in horror as history rejected the murder.

##### The Chronoglyph Vaults
::::::
}}

{{wide
:
}}
  
The prince's corpse kept reviving, his death unraveling like a broken thread, until Elias realized the truth: some fates cannot be changed, only **redirected**. He gathered scholars of forbidden chronomancy and formed the first Heralds, their mission to fray destiny's edges until the doomed prince's future could be snipped away entirely.  

Their true power manifested when they recovered the **Sands of the First Eclipse**, hourglass grains that showed every possible death of every living thing. These sands didn't just predict—they *prescribed*, their flow subtly altering reality to match their visions. Their first great work, **The Edict of Unhappening**, erased an entire rebellion from history, replacing it with a false peace that left the kingdom vulnerable to their influence. The Heralds grew, recruiting seers willing to have their eyelids stitched shut to better see time's flow, and assassins who killed not people but *possibilities*, strangling futures in their crib.  

A faction sought to use the Sands not just to edit history, but to **unspool it entirely**—to reset existence to a moment before the apocalypse was woven into time's fabric. The ensuing **Causality Schism** saw rival chronomancers weaponizing paradoxes—entire bloodlines blinked out when ancestors were erased, while cities became palimpsests of conflicting histories. The conflict ended when Elias (or a version of him from a dead timeline) sacrificed himself to the Sands, becoming a living temporal anchor that stabilized their power. The survivors awoke with their pasts rewritten, knowing only that they must **keep cutting**.  

Their magnum opus—**The Silent Hour**—proved their ultimate thesis: *time could be silenced*. They froze a kingdom in an eternal moment, its people suspended mid-breath, their collective future harvested like ripe fruit. When the Sands settled, only the Heralds remained, their pockets heavy with stolen seconds.  

Now, they walk among history's pages as living erasures, their **Chronographers** and **Fate Surgeons** excising events too dangerous to remain. Their next incision? **The Final Sundering**, where the world will learn the last truth: *"The apocalypse isn't coming—it's already happened, and we're just living in the echo."*  

### Timeline
- **Founding Era:** Elias the Untimely attempts to murder Prince Althric in the **Cradle Paradox**.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Sands of the First Eclipse** are recovered from a tomb that doesn't exist.  
- **Expansion Era:** The Heralds begin systematically editing historical events.  
- **Schism Era:** The **Causality Schism** fractures the cult over preservation versus reset.  
- **Ascendance Era:** **The Silent Hour** proves time can be frozen and harvested.  
- **Present Era:** The Heralds prepare for **The Final Sundering**—the complete excision of the apocalypse from history.

### Location and Base
Buried deep beneath the ruins of the Clockmaker's Cathedral, the Chronoglyph Vaults exist outside normal time. The entrance is a massive sundial that only appears during solar eclipses, its shadow forming a doorway when aligned perfectly. Inside, the vaults resemble an infinite library where the shelves spiral in non-Euclidean patterns, each corridor leading to different eras. Books here don't contain words, but compressed moments of time - opening one unleashes a temporal echo of its recorded event. The air smells of ozone and old parchment, with the occasional metallic tang of paradox energy.

The true heart of the vaults is the Editing Chamber, where the cult's most dangerous work occurs. Here, time behaves like clay - historians knead the air, sculpting new causal chains while chronomancers "trim" unwanted timelines with silver shears that snip moments from existence. The chamber's floor is a mosaic of frozen moments, each tile showing a scene that may or may not have happened. At the center floats the Tear of Chronepsis, a liquid crystal that shows all possible apocalypses simultaneously.
:
### Pecularity
The cult's most disturbing trait is their "Temporal Echo" condition. Prolonged exposure to their rituals causes members to exist slightly out of phase with normal time. Their shadows move seconds before they do, their voices are heard before their mouths move, and wounds appear on their bodies hours before being inflicted. In advanced cases, Heralds begin remembering events that haven't happened yet, speaking in perfect unison with their future selves, or even briefly overlapping with alternate versions of themselves from discarded timelines. The most powerful members exist in a permanent state of temporal dissonance, appearing as living mosaics of their past, present, and potential future selves.
:
### Public Perception
To the world, the Dusk Heralds are a scholar's myth—the explanation for deja vu, for historical inconsistencies, for those moments when the sun seems to hiccup in the sky. Kings dismiss them as "clock-watchers with delusions of grandeur," while peasants blame them for bad harvests and stillborn calves. This suits the Heralds perfectly. Their greatest defense is the Law of Temporal Plausibility: by making their true nature seem like superstition, they ensure no one questions the gaps in their work. Those who learn too much are rarely killed—instead, they're offered the chance to become Living Footnotes, human anchors who stabilize altered timelines by believing in both versions of history.

##### The Echo of Lost Causes
{margin-left:-12px}
:::::::::
### Membership
The Dusk Heralds recruit from three fates: the Doomed (those marked by apocalyptic visions), the Erased (people whose existences have been altered by timeline changes), and the Timeless (beings born outside causality, like certain fey or planar travelers). Initiates undergo the Rite of the Split Second, where they must witness and accept an alternate version of their own death. The highest ranks, the Fate Surgeons, have their hands replaced with chronomantic tools—silver shears that cut causal chains, needle-fingers that suture new events into history, and palm-mounted hourglasses that measure a life's remaining sand.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## The Ouroboros Hourglass  

*Legendary, Requires Attunement (Cursed)*

}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This time-warping relic consists of two conjoined hourglasses - one flowing with black sand that erases memories, the other with white sand that implants false ones. The frame is made from the fused vertebrae of a time dragon, each bone inscribed with chronomancy runes that glow blue when active. When inverted, it doesn't just measure time—it *edits* it, allowing brief manipulations of causality that ripple outward like stones in a temporal pond.  

---

#### **Properties**  
- **Sand of Unmaking:** As an action, pour black sand onto a creature or object. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence save or have one memory from the last 24 hours erased. This can remove knowledge of entire events or people.  

- **Sand of Remaking:** Pour white sand to implant a 5-minute false memory (DC 18 Wisdom save to resist). The memory must be plausible and cannot contradict major established facts.  

- **Paradox Reversal:** Once per long rest, invert both hourglasses simultaneously. You may reroll any one event that occurred within 60 feet in the last round, forcing the new result. All creatures except you forget the original outcome.  

- **Final Grain:** When you would die, the hourglass shatters. You reform 1d4 days earlier in the timeline at the location you first attuned to it, but all your memories after that point are gone.

### Chronarch Solrian the shatered's Backstory
Solrian was not always a prophet of ruin. Once, he was a man of ink-stained hands and quiet halls, a respected historian at the Royal Astral College, known for his calm brilliance and monastic discipline. His obsession was the Lost Century—a strange silence in the world’s timeline, an entire era scrubbed from every known chronicle. No wars. No births. No songs. As though the world itself had paused and then forgotten it ever had.

His breakthrough came in the form of a brittle parchment unearthed beneath the College's oldest observatory. Named the Ashen Ephemera, the scroll contained records not of what was, but of what might have been: a king who lived and died twice, a plague that ended before it began, a sunrise that never came. The ink shimmered oddly, resisting transcription. And when Solrian read it aloud in solitude, something broke.

For three seconds, the city around him flickered. The stained-glass windows cracked and healed. Vines crept through the stone. Towers lay in rubble, then stood once more. No one else noticed. But Solrian did.

From that moment on, his world became unstable. He tore through libraries, piecing together half-erased footnotes, contradictory dates, forgotten obituaries. He stopped sleeping. His peers dismissed him as eccentric—until he uncovered the Dusk Codex, a tome bound in timeworn leather that whispered its contents only to him. It did not speak of fire or flood. It spoke of unwriting—a future where the world did not burn or freeze, but was simply edited away, one thought, one breath at a time.

Driven beyond sanity, Solrian performed the forbidden Rite of the Split Second, a temporal schism that shattered his consciousness across a thousand unrealised timelines. When he awoke, he was no longer entirely here. His left eye sees the present. His right eye sees what almost was. His voice carries futures like echoes in a cathedral.

His flesh bears the scars of wars he never fought but one day might. His arms twitch with phantom pain from blades yet to be drawn. He weeps sometimes—not for loss, but for lives he almost lived.

Under his guidance, the Dusk Heralds rose. They are not doomsayers. They are archivists of the end, chronicling the unraveling with fervent devotion. They burn libraries not out of hatred, but mercy—lest the stories be remembered into oblivion. They see history as a sick animal, begging to be put down.

### The Echo of Lost Causes's Backstory
No one remembers the Oracle’s original name. She was once a saint of the Order of the Golden Dawn, a healer who could mend any wound—until she tried to save a dying prince and touched a temporal wound, a rift where time had broken. The moment she made contact, she saw every possible death he could have died, every life he might have lived, and the weight of those unmade futures shatered her mind. Now, she exists as a living echo, her body flickering between states—sometimes solid, sometimes translucent, as if she’s barely clinging to the present.

The Dusk Heralds found her wandering the ruins of a battlefield that hadn’t happened yet. She spoke in riddles that came true hours later, her voice out of sync with her lips. They named her the Echo and bound her to the Chronolith, a monolith carved with every possible ending to the world. Her prophecies are not of the future, but of lost pasts—warnings of changes already made, of people who no longer exist. The cult uses her visions to guide their edits, but each one costs her: with every prophecy, she becomes less real, her body fading like ink in rain.

Her final fate is already written. The Codex predicts she will unexist at the moment of the apocalypse, her final breath unraveling the last thread keeping her here. Until then, she whispers to Solrian in the dead of night, her voice the sound of a clock winding down.

### Secret
The Sands inside the hourglass are actually crystallized fragments of the apocalypse they seek to prevent. Each use brings the end times marginally closer—a fact known only to the Chronarch. The cult's greatest challenge isn't altering time, but determining which changes won't paradoxically cause the very doom they're trying to avert.

### Code of Conduct
The cult operates under the Doctrine of Necessary Erasures: no action is forbidden if it preserves the timeline, but every alteration must leave no paradox scars. Members communicate in "temporal cant"—phrases that change meaning depending on when they're heard ("the rose blooms at midnight" might warn of an assassination at dawn, or memorialize one that already happened). Punishment takes the form of chronological exile, where offenders are abandoned in time loops of their worst mistakes, forced to relive their failures until they become compliant or unravel entirely. The only unforgivable sin is hesitation—when editing time, doubt creates paradoxes, and paradoxes attract the attention of things that live between seconds.


### Hook I
When the party first encounters the village, it appears ordinary—a cluster of thatched cottages nestled between golden wheat fields, smoke curling from chimneys, children chasing geese through the muddy square. The villagers greet them as old friends, recalling shared memories that never happened. The innkeeper insists he kept their usual room ready. The blacksmith asks after a sword he supposedly repaired for them last winter. A little girl tugs at a warrior's cloak, begging for another story about the "great storm" they weathered together.

But the cracks show quickly to those who look. The church's stained glass depicts saints no one recognizes. The miller's wife sets an extra plate at dinner each night for a son she can't quite describe. In the cemetery, half the headstones bear the same date of death. The party soon realizes every person in Eldermere has two sets of memories—the false ones implanted by the Heralds, and fleeting glimpses of their true past, surfacing like drowning men gasping for air.

The truth unfolds in the abandoned chronomancer's workshop beneath the old windmill. Veyla, the Herald responsible, reveals Eldermere was "rescued" from a timeline where plague wiped out the entire region. By transplanting the village into the present, she saved hundreds of lives—but at the cost of unraveling causality. Now the fabric of reality strains under the weight of this paradox. Some villagers flicker between living and plague-rotted versions of themselves. Others wake screaming from nightmares of burning in fires that haven't happened yet. The wheat grows unnaturally fast, ripening from seed to harvest in a day before withering to dust.

Veyla offers the party an impossible choice: help her stabilize the graft by finding replacement memories to patch the inconsistencies (requiring them to essentially rewrite these people's souls), or trigger a temporal collapse that will erase Eldermere completely—along with any evidence the party ever interacted with them. As the decision looms, the village grows increasingly unstable. A child vanishes mid-conversation. A well fills with blood that turns to wine when examined. The church bell tolls thirteen times at midnight, though the steeple stands empty and broken.

### Hook II
A nobleman, Edrick, arrives at his castle courtyard three days late, with his clothes torn and his favorite hound's corpse slung across his shoulders. The household initially rejoices, but soon notices the changes in Edrick, including scars from battles he never fought, complex lute melodies, and a slow shadow. The party investigates, uncovering two competing truths: the stablemaster claims he buried Edrick's body in the woods, and a confession from a jealous cousin admitting to the murder. However, Edrick remains alive, with wounds and a distorted appearance. The trail leads to a Dusk Herald operating from the abandoned clocktower, where they learn the terrible truth: the original Edrick died, and the Herald attempted a "temporal graft" to stitch a version of Edrick from another timeline into Edrick's. The party must navigate this temporal disaster while being hunted by both versions of Edrick, the original's vengeful ghost and the duplicate who will do anything to maintain his stolen existence. Their final choice will determine whether the entire region becomes trapped in Edrick's unstable timeline.

### Encounter table
| Roll | Encounter | Description |
|:----:|:-----------:|---------|  
| 1 | **The Stuttering Scholar** | A Herald mid-paradox, flickering between 3 versions of themselves (young/apprentice, current/zealot, future/repentant). Each version argues with the others, revealing conflicting clues. |  
| **2** | **The Stillborn Battle** | A 50-ft radius where time is frozen mid-combat—arrows hover in air, soldiers mid-swing. Disturbing anything risks "unfreezing" the violence with the party at its center. |  
| **3** | **The Paradox Hound** | A ghostly wolf with two extra heads—one from its past (puppy), one from its future (skeletal). It howls in reverse, causing déjà vu (Disadvantage on next roll). |  
| **4** | **The Rewound Assassin** | A Herald killer who dies gruesomely at the start of combat... only to reappear 1 round later, reliving their death until they get it "right." |  
| **5** | **The Memory Leech** | A Herald scribe holding an hourglass that drains a random skill/memory from those nearby (DC 15 INT save or lose proficiency for 1d4 hours). |  
| **6** | **The Chronal Trap** | A "harmless" object (chest, door, etc.) that, when touched, forces the party to re-experience the last 30 seconds twice—with any damage/expended resources being cumulative. |

##### Archdrow Xalyth Vrinn
:::::::
{{OrgName
## The Eclipse Covenant
}}
:::
{{monster,orgstat
{{columns:2,statpart1



**Leadership**: Archdrow Xalyth Vrinn::

**Alignment**: Lawful Evil::

}}
---
### Goal
The Eclipse Covenant seeks to enact the Great Dusk—a permanent, worldwide eclipse that will extinguish all sunlight forever. They believe this will free shadow creatures from their weakness to light and elevate the drow as the dominant race.
### Ability

As a bonus action, a Duskborn may sever their shadow, which becomes a Silhouette Minion (AC 14, HP 30, mimics the cultist’s abilities). If the cultist dies, the shadow gains free will—and a grudge.




}}

\column
::::::::::

### Abstract
A clandestine alliance of drow fanatics, shadow dragons, and warlocks who have sworn to extinguish the sun, the Eclipse Covenant operates from the deepest Underdark and the darkest corners of the Shadowfell. They believe daylight is an aberration—a cruel joke of the gods that must be undone. Their rituals drain the light from captured celestial beings, their weapons are forged from the essence of eclipses, and their temples are built in places where the sun has never shone. Their ultimate goal? The Great Dusk, a permanent eclipse that will shroud the world in endless night.

:
### Hierarchy
At the apex stands Archdrow Xalyth Vrinn, her word absolute as the void. Beneath her, the Shadow Conclave—a council of the most powerful shadow dragons and warlocks—plots the Great Dusk in whispered meetings held in lightless chambers. The Umbra Knights, drow warriors clad in armor forged from eclipsed steel, enforce the Covenant’s will with blades that drink light. The Penumbral Adepts, warlocks and wizards who have traded their sight for shadow magic, conduct blasphemous rituals to weaken the sun. At the lowest rung slither the Darkseed Spawn, wretched creatures transformed by failed experiments in eternal night—living warnings of the Covenant’s power.

:
### History
The Eclipse Covenant began in the **Year of the Black Sun**, when the celestial scholar **Veylis the Unseeing** stared directly into a total solar eclipse—and saw *something* staring back. The vision burned her eyes to cinders, but in the darkness, she beheld the **Twin Hungers**: two primordial entities, one devouring light, the other gorging on shadow. She wrote her revelations in a tome of smoked glass and mercury, **The Apocrypha of the Veiled Sun**, before her hands crumbled to ash.  

Her first disciple, the warlock **Dain of the Dusk**, performed the **Rite of the Sundered Sphere**, splitting his own shadow from his body and binding it into a living weapon. The Covenant grew as others replicated the ritual, their severed shadows forming a **Silhouette Court**—an army of hollow, sentient darkness. Their first true atrocity was the **Feast of the New Moon**, where they eclipsed an entire city under a manufactured night, leaving only faceless husks where people once stood.  

Their power solidified when they uncovered the **Oculus of the Abyss**, a lens forged from a dead god’s pupil.

##### The Umbral Cathedral

}}

}}
  
Peering through it, they learned to **pluck stars from the sky**, imprisoning them in obsidian reliquaries to fuel their rituals. Their grand design? To **merge the material plane with the Umbral Hinterlands**, a realm of pure negation where the Twin Hungers slumber.  

The Covenant’s greatest schism came during the **Dusk Schism**, when half the cult sought to *become* eclipses—living voids that consumed all light—while the other half wished to *serve* the Hungers as heralds of eternal night. The conflict ended when the Oculus *blinked*, erasing the dissenters from existence. Now, the Covenant operates in perfect, silent unity, their agents **Duskborn** and **Umbralscribes** infiltrating libraries, observatories, and power centers to prepare for the **Great Occlusion**—the day the sun dies forever.  

### Timeline  
  
- **Founding Era:** Veylis the Unseeing gazes into the eclipse and goes blind.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Rite of the Sundered Sphere** creates the first Silhouette Court.  
- **Expansion Era:** The **Feast of the New Moon** annihilates a city.  
- **Schism Era:** The **Dusk Schism** splits the cult; the Oculus purges the dissenters.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The Covenant begins harvesting stars for the **Great Occlusion**.  
- **Present Era:** Agents manipulate events to plunge the world into unending twilight.

### Location and Base
A colossal temple carved from a single piece of shadow-stuff, floating in a void between the Shadowfell and Material Plane. Its spires are made of solidified darkness, its stained-glass windows depict scenes of eternal night, and its altar is a perfect sphere of nothingness that hums with anti-light. The air is thick with the scent of burnt ozone and the whispers of long-dead suns.
:
### Pecularity
The cult’s members despise light so utterly that they ritually blind themselves in one eye upon joining. Their weapons and armor are forged from "eclipsed steel," a metal that absorbs light and grows stronger in darkness.
:
### Public Perception
To outsiders, they are boogeymen—rumors of "the Red Surgeons" who steal children to replenish their flesh-vaults. Some kingdoms tolerate them as battlefield medics (who turn prisoners into war-golems), while others burn their clinics on sight. Their symbol—a knife splitting a sinew knot—is often found carved into the flesh of their victims.
:
### Membership
The Creed recruits from the desperate, the disfigured, and the deranged. Surgeons, butchers, and artists are prized, but any who show aptitude for "biological artistry" are inducted. Higher ranks (Gorecardinals and Sanguine Sculptors) undergo the Grand Transfiguration, replacing their organs with those of monsters or celestials. The lowest ranks are Living Cadavers, test subjects stitched together from spare parts.
:
### Code of Conduct
"Flesh is but clay; pain, the chisel." The Creed operates under a brutal hierarchy of mend or be mended. Disciples must submit to voluntary surgeries to "perfect" their forms, and failure in ritual is met with punitive grafting—limbs replaced with those of failed initiates. Their sacred law, the Crimson Catechism, demands they "remake the impure" by any means, whether through grotesque surgeries or forced amalgamation. Mercy is a weakness; scars are scripture.

##### Velsharoon the Blind Seer
{margin-left:-12px}
:::::::::
### Secret
The cult’s inner circle knows the Twin Hungers are not gods—they are prisoners. The eclipse that birthed the Covenant was no accident; it was a celestial lock cracking. The Oculus of the Abyss is one of seven keys meant to keep the Hungers bound, but the cult, in their madness, uses it to pick the lock. Every stolen star, every manufactured night, brings the entities closer to freedom. The Covenant’s highest ranks whisper a final truth: "When the last light dies, we won’t rule the darkness—we’ll be its first meal."

#### Cursed Artefact 
## Obsidian Corona

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster or warlock)*
}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This black circlet is forged from shadow-wrought silver and inset with a disc of polished Voidglass—the crystallised eye of a fallen solar angel, still faintly weeping motes of golden light that burn the circlet from within. When worn, the air around the attuned dims, colours drain from the world, and shadows grow unnaturally long. Reflections near the wearer show a black sun burning in place of their face. The Obsidian Corona is both a crown and a curse—a beacon of night to come.



#### **Properties**

* **Solar Nullification:** While attuned, you are immune to radiant damage and sunlight sensitivity. Sunlight in a 30-foot radius around you dims to twilight, providing lightly obscured cover to creatures of your choice.

* **Ecliptic Convergence:** Once per long rest, you may invoke the Corona to cast *Sunburst* in reverse. Instead of radiant light, the spell unleashes a 60-foot radius sphere of **sun-draining shadow**. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take 12d6 necrotic damage and be blinded for 1 minute. Celestials and creatures in direct sunlight make the save with disadvantage.

* **Shadowbinding:** As an action, you may target a creature within 60 feet. Its shadow detaches and binds it in place for 1 minute (DC 17 Strength save ends at the end of each turn). While bound, the creature cannot teleport, fly, or turn invisible. Recharge on a short rest.

#### **Curse – Eclipse’s Hunger:**

The Obsidian Corona craves light and loathes warmth. Each dawn you are exposed to natural sunlight without extinguishing it (magically or physically), you must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion as the crown sears your mind with visions of the coming Great Dusk.

Additionally, each time you kill a celestial or extinguish a magical light source of 5th level or higher, the Corona stores a charge of **Eclipse Power** (maximum 3). When all three charges are filled, the next time you sleep, you do not dream—you **vanish into the Shadowfell** until your allies can perform a ritual to retrieve you… or forget you ever existed.

### Archdrow Xalyth Vrinn's Backstory
Once a revered high priestess of Lolth, Xalyth Vrinn was the terror of many Underdark courts—a master of intrigue, devotion, and cruelty in equal measure. She spun webs of political conquest as easily as her sacred matron spun silk. But even amidst the whispers of spiders and sacrifice, Xalyth began to hear something deeper—older. Not a voice in her ears, but in the marrow of her bones: the slow, patient hunger of something vast and starless. A being without form or face, known only as The Void That Hungers. It called to her not with promises, but with truth—that light was a prison, and darkness the only honest god.

It showed her a world where no dawn would rise. A world not of chaos, but of quiet dominion—where the drow would walk openly across the surface without fear, where shadow dragons circled overhead like divine sentinels, and where the magic of warlocks did not come with chains, but with devotion to nothingness itself. She saw the weakness in Lolth’s endless scheming, her addiction to power plays and paranoia. Xalyth saw the Void, and was changed.

She abandoned the Spider Queen in a single act of desecration—burning her own chapel and sacrificing her entire temple to the darkness between stars. The screams became her hymn, and from the ashes rose the Eclipse Covenant—an alliance of heretics, outcasts, and visionaries, each bound to one apocalyptic creed: "No dawn shall come again."

Now, Xalyth’s form is barely mortal. Her skin no longer reflects light; it devours it. Her veins pulse with a sentient darkness that whispers from her every movement. Her eyes are twin voids, orbiting unknowable gravity, and her voice carries the weight of a thousand extinguished suns. In her presence, candles falter, magical light dims, and even memories of warmth fade like breath on cold stone.

She has sacrificed more than her faith—she has offered up her own bloodline to the Void. Her children, her kin, all burned in the Covenant’s rituals. Each death was not an offering, but a message: to hold back the light, no price is too high.

Her most terrifying weapon is the Umbra Scepter—a blackened staff carved from the spine of a slain solar deity, still faintly radiant with defiance. When raised, it doesn’t cast a shadow—it creates one. A void so complete it erases light, time, and even sound. With it, she can silence battlefields and darken cities. Some say the sun flickered once, briefly, the first time she used it in full.

The Great Dusk is coming. Xalyth does not hope—it is beneath her now. She only prepares. And when the final sun sets and does not rise again, she will not claim a throne. She will kneel, and let the Void That Hungers take the sky.

### Velsharoon the Blind Seer's Backstory
Born without eyes, Velsharoon was cast into the Underdark as an infant, left to die in the endless dark. But the shadows spoke to him—they showed him visions of a world without light, where the sightless would reign supreme. The Eclipse Covenant found him writhing in prophetic fits, his empty sockets weeping black ichor that formed prophecies upon the stone. Now, he sits in the Chamber of Absolute Night, a void so complete that even darkvision fails. His prophecies are not spoken—they are carved into the flesh of willing (and unwilling) scribes by spectral claws that emerge from his body.

His most infamous vision was the Six Signs of Dusk, a series of omens that would herald the Great Dusk: the death of a sun god, the birth of a shadow dragon, the fall of a celestial, the rise of a blind king, the silencing of dawn’s chorus, and the final eclipse. The Covenant has already fulfilled four.

The Covenant thrives on ambiguity. Let players wonder: Are the Hungers evil, or is the cult’s interpretation wrong? Play their shadows as tragic figures—whispering warnings, not just threats.

### Hook I
A village reports that their nights grow longer, their days dimmer. Crops wither, and children whisper of a "black sun" in their dreams. The party arrives to find the villagers’ shadows missing—yet at midnight, those shadows return, moving independently, dragging their owners toward a crumbling observatory where a Duskborn conducts the Rite of the Devoured Dawn.

The cultists plan to sacrifice the village’s light to the Oculus, but the party discovers a worse truth: the villagers’ shadows are already dead. Their real shadows were consumed days ago; what puppets them now are shards of the Twin Hungers, testing their strength. If the ritual completes, the Hungers will gain a foothold in the material plane—a living eclipse that follows the party wherever they go.

Clues point to a celestial mirror hidden in the ruins, capable of sealing the Oculus—but the cult’s Silhouette Assassins stalk the players, their bodies merging with darkness. The party must choose: destroy the Oculus (and risk unleashing the Hungers prematurely) or let the village become a testing ground for the coming eternal night.

### Hook II
A heretic cultist, Veylis’s last living descendant, offers the party a deal: steal the Oculus from the Covenant’s vault and deliver it to the Astral Clocktower, where a renegade umbralscribe can reset the celestial lock. But the prophet is lying—they plan to use the Oculus to merge with the Hungers, becoming a god of endings.

The vault is a nightmare of inverted physics—gravity shifts toward darkness, and the party’s own shadows betray them, whispering secrets to the cult. The Oculus is guarded by the Eclipsed Sentinel, a knight whose armor is made of solidified midnight, wielding a sword that drinks light.

If the party retrieves the Oculus, the prophet’s betrayal unfolds mid-ritual at the Clocktower. The sky tears, revealing the Hungers’ maws. The party must decide: aid the umbralscribe in a desperate rewrite of fate, shatter the Oculus and blind themselves forever, or accept the prophet’s offer and become heralds of the eclipse.

| 1 | **Duskborn Pilgrims** | 1d4+1 robed figures walk barefoot on shadows, their eyes sewn shut. They offer to "bless" the party with a **Nightbrand** (a harmless black mark that glows in moonlight—and lets the Covenant track them). |  
| 2 | **The Hungering Eclipse** | A 50-foot radius of unnatural darkness moves against the wind. Inside, the party’s **shadows animate** and attack (AC 13, HP 22, resist all damage until exposed to light). |  
| 3 | **The Oculus’s Price** | A former cultist, now just a **sentient void** in human skin (CR 5), hunts for their stolen shadow. They beg the party to retrieve it from the Covenant—but the shadow *likes* its new masters. |  
| 4 | **The Black Choir** | 2d6 Silhouette Minions sing a hymn that drains light sources. Every round, a random magic item’s glow dims (1d4 charges lost). Destroying the "conductor" (a skull filled with liquid starlight) ends the effect. |  
| 5 | **The Eclipse Reenactment** | Cultists force villagers to reenact Veylis’s first vision using a **mirror-backed stage**. Those who look at the "eclipse" (a portal to the Umbral Hinterlands) must save or gain **voidsight** (see truths, but take 1d10 psychic damage/hour). |  
| 6 | **The Star-Eater’s Maw** | A Duskborn **Gorecardinal** (CR 7) ritualistically devours a captured celestial (a weakened **Couatl** or **Pegasus**). Interrupting the feast summons 1d4 **Eclipsed Beasts** (shadow-mantled predators with a 10-foot light-devouring aura). |

### Goal
The Eclipse Serpents seek to initiate the Great Shedding - a celestial event where all mortal forms will slough away like dead skin, revealing the divine serpent forms hidden within every living being. They believe the current world is merely a chrysalis stage, and through blood sacrifices to their Eclipse Drakes and the acquisition of sacred serpent artifacts, they can accelerate this cosmic molting process. Their ultimate ritual involves using the Celestial Fang to pierce the Veil Between Skins, allowing the First Scales (primordial serpent deities) to emerge and reclaim a universe they believe was stolen from them.
### Ability

Once per short rest, your fangs deal an extra 4d6 necrotic. If the target dies within 1 minute, its skin becomes a prophetic scroll.

### Abstract
The Eclipse Serpents slither in the spaces between faith and forbidden knowledge, a cult of yuan-ti and serpent-touched zealots who worship the celestial serpents they believe coil around the pillars of creation. To them, the world is a fragile egg, and their sacred duty is to crack it open—to usher in the Great Shedding, when all mortal forms will molt away, revealing the divine serpents coiled within every soul. They whisper in the tongue of scales, trace constellations only visible to lidless eyes, and sacrifice warm-blooded creatures to the Eclipse Drakes, ancient serpents said to slumber in the black veins of the earth. Their temples are hidden in eclipsed valleys where the sun never fully rises, their rituals timed to celestial alignments that thin the barrier between flesh and the First Scales, the primordial serpents who wrote destiny in venom. The cult’s ultimate goal is not mere apotheosis—it is the unraveling of all false forms, the moment when the world finally sheds its skin, and every living thing remembers it was once, and will be again, a serpent unbound by time.

:
### Hierarchy
The cult moves as a serpent does—in layers, each more transformed than the last. At the bottom are the Fangless, new initiates who have yet to shed their warm-blooded weakness; they serve as spies and thieves, stealing relics and kidnapping sacrifices for the temples. Above them are the Molted, those who have undergone the first rituals, their skin loosening, their teeth sharpening, their blood thinning to venom. These are the warriors and priests, the ones who conduct the rites of the Eclipse Drakes. Higher still are the Scaleborn, yuan-ti or those so transformed they are nearly indistinguishable from true serpentfolk; they whisper the Chant of the First Scales, their voices weaving spells that turn flesh malleable. And at the apex is Xalzithis and her Eclipse Council, those who have glimpsed the Drakes in the dark and returned with their minds half-shed, their bodies flickering between serpent and shadow. The Oracle exists outside this structure, a living omen whose words guide the cult’s fangs. But even she serves the greater truth: the Great Shedding comes, and all will writhe in its wake.

:
### History
The Eclipse Serpents began with a single, unblinking eye—the dying vision of **High Priestess Zalithra the Forsaken**, who saw the truth as venom dissolved her mortal form. When the temple of her people collapsed during a solar

eclipse, burying her beneath carved serpent-stones, she did not die—she *molted*. Her body split open like overripe fruit, revealing glistening obsidian scales beneath, and when she crawled from the rubble, her tongue had forked into a sacred instrument. The surviving priests, too terrified to look away, fell to their knees—and by nightfall, their eyes had all turned to lidless amber, their blood already cooling toward venom.  

Their true power awoke when they uncovered the **Venom Codex**, an ancient text written in crystallized serpent venom. When tasted, it didn’t just reveal secrets—it *rewrote* the taster, their bones hollowing, their skin growing translucent. Their first miracle, **The Great Shedding**, transformed an entire monastery of scholars into serpentine oracles, their bodies unraveling into living scrolls that hissed prophecies in tongues no human throat could shape. The cult grew, recruiting those who craved the purity of scales—alchemists who distilled their own blood into poison, astronomers who charted eclipses in human skin, assassins whose kisses carried divine paralysis.  

A faction sought to use the Codex not just to transform, but to *replace* the gods—to shed the world’s skin and reveal the serpents coiled beneath creation. The ensuing conflict, the **Schism of the Forked Tongue**, saw rival ascendants weaponizing venom—entire cities froze in mid-step as their blood turned to black ice, while others melted into formless flesh, ripe for reshaping. The war ended when Zalithra (or something wearing her scales) appeared in the temple depths and *"corrected"* the Codex. The survivors awoke with their mouths stitched shut by living thread, knowing only that they must **continue the shedding**.  

Their magnum opus—**The Eclipse Maw**—proved their ultimate thesis: *flesh was merely a chrysalis*. A kingdom’s worth of souls dissolved into a single, endless molt, their memories becoming scales in the cosmic serpent’s hide. By the final sloughing, only the Serpents remained, their bodies now gleaming with stolen divinity.  

Now, they slither through courts and crypts alike, their **Fangmasters** and **Scale-Scribes** harvesting skin for the grand metamorphosis. Their next shedding? The **Celestial Molt**, where the world will learn the final truth: *"You were never human—you just forgot what you truly are."*  

### Timeline

  
- **Founding Era:** Zalithra the Forsaken emerges reborn from temple ruins during the **First Eclipse**.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Venom Codex** is unearthed, granting power over flesh and fate.  
- **Expansion Era:** The Serpents turn scholars into prophets across the continent.  
- **Schism Era:** The **Schism of the Forked Tongue** fractures the cult over transcendence versus tyranny.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The **Eclipse Maw** consumes an entire kingdom’s mortality.  
- **Present Era:** The Serpents prepare their **Celestial Molt**—a shedding to end history.

### Location and Base
Deep beneath the Obsidian Peaks lies the Temple of the Black Sun, a cavernous complex where the walls pulse with the rhythm of sleeping serpents. The main chamber is dominated by a colossal obsidian ziggurat, its steps carved with constellations that shift when not observed directly. At its summit floats a miniature black sun - a sphere of liquid shadow that pulses like a heart, casting no light but making all serpent scales in its presence gleam with unnatural radiance. The air smells of burnt ozone and molting skin, thick enough to taste.

The temple's lower levels contain the Pit of Shedding, where initiates undergo their first transformation. The floor is covered in a layer of discarded skins that whisper secrets when stepped upon. Here, the Eclipse Drakes - massive serpentine entities with scales like polished void - coil around stone pillars, their forked tongues tasting the fear of sacrifices brought before them. The walls weep black venom that collects in sacred basins, used to anoint those deemed worthy of the Hymn of Molting.

Most terrifying is the Chamber of the First Scales, accessible only by swimming through a pool of liquid shadow. This perfectly circular room contains fossilized remains of the original cosmic serpents, their petrified coils forming a spiral pattern that induces visions in those who walk its path. At the center stands the Celestial Fang - a dagger-shaped meteorite fragment embedded in the stone, pulsing with dark energy. Those who touch it report hearing the hissing of unborn universes.
:
### Pecularity
The cult's most disturbing trait is their "Grafting Ritual" where initiates have living serpents sewn into their flesh - these serpentine symbiotes gradually replace organs and limbs over years of service. Fully indoctrinated members can dislocate their jaws like vipers, secrete venom from their fingertips, and some develop translucent second eyelids. Their blood is notably cold and dark, often used as ink for their profane scrolls. Most unnerving is their collective ability to "taste time" - they experience memories and premonitions as distinct flavors on their forked tongues.
:
### Public Perception
To outsiders, the Eclipse Serpents are a merchant cult trading in rare venoms—until entire villages vanish during eclipses. Nobles fear them as poisoners who leave no trace, while scholars whisper of "the Lidless Curse," where victims’ eyes become unblinking amber, their bodies slowly hardening into statues of coiled snakes.

:
### Membership
The cult recruits from alchemists, outcasts, and those born with serpent marks. Initiates undergo the First Bite, drinking venom that attunes them to the Codex’s whispers.

##### Vissathra the Tongueless Prophet
{margin-left:-12px}
:::::::::
Full members are branded with a fang-and-eclipse sigil, their veins darkening as they ascend ranks. The inner circle, the Ophidian Council, are yuan-ti or humans so transformed their skeletons flex like serpents.
:
### Code of Conduct
The Eclipse Serpents live by the Doctrine of the Shedding Fang: all weakness must be molted away. Members must ritually scar themselves with serpent fangs, for "pain is the ink of truth." Lies are punished by forced ingestion of memory venom, which dissolves the offender’s recollections of their former life. The highest law is "See or Be Skinned"—those who witness sacred rites must either join or become parchment for the Codex.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## The Venom Codex 

*Legendary, Requires Attunement (Cursed)*  
}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This living tome is bound in the shed skin of an Eclipse Drake, its pages made from stretched human tongues preserved in serpent venom. The text appears as shifting constellations of fang-marks that rewrite themselves when unobserved. When "read" (by licking the pages to taste the venom), it reveals cosmic truths—but each revelation replaces a memory with serpentine instinct.  



#### **Properties**  
- **Ophidian Revelation:** As an action, you can taste a page. Roll a d6:
\column
  | Roll| Result |
  |:---:|------- |
  | 1-2 | Learn a secret, but permanently lose a language |  
  | 3-4 | Gain +5 to one roll in the next hour, but your skin hardens (AC -1) |  
  | 5-6 | See 1 minute into the future, but your eyes become lidless (disadvantage vs bright light) |  

:
- **The First Shedding:** Once per long rest, submerge the Codex in fresh blood. It produces 1d4 **Serpent Sigils** (tattoos that grant poison immunity but cause -2 Charisma as scales appear).  

- **Final Truth:** When you die, your skin peels away to become a new page. Your soul remains as a whispering footnote.

### High Ascendant Xalzithis the Unblinking's Backstory
Xalzithis was not born—she was chosen. Once, she was merely a yuan-ti pureblood priestess, her scales dulled by centuries of decline, her faith a dim echo in the ruins of a forgotten serpent empire. She spent her days tending the altars of obsolete gods, whispering rites that even the stones seemed to have forgotten. But the gods did not answer—not until she descended into the catacombs beneath the Temple of the Black Sun. There, beneath strata of time and ash, she did not find relics. She found breath. She found hunger. She found a god that had never been born and never died.

The creature that awaited her was no statue, no dream. It was a living Eclipse Drake, coiled in silence, so vast its body threaded through the ancient halls like the roots of the world. Its scales drank all light; its eyes reflected only the abyss between stars. It did not speak, for speech was too small a vessel. Instead, it unwove her. For three nights, her flesh turned to vapor. Her bones melted into her blood, and her thoughts cracked open like eggshells. When she reformed, her eyes were liquid eclipse—not black, but void, the total absence of meaning and light. In that unmaking, she gained perfect clarity: the gods mortals worship are illusions—shed skins, discarded forms. The true deities are the serpents beneath, whose bodies form the ley lines of the world, whose venom flows as ink across the pages of fate.

Xalzithis returned not as a priestess, but as a prophet. Under her vision, the Eclipse Serpents—once scattered apostates and fang-worshippers—became a coiled doctrine, a cult with purpose, venom, and direction. She delved deeper into the temples carved beneath the world's crust, where Eclipse Drakes slumber within hollow moons and speak in tidal pulses. From them, she learned the Hymn of Molting, a sacred transformation that begins in the marrow. Under its song, flesh loosens like wet paper, bones bend like vines, and identity slides off like a second skin.

Her most devoted acolytes have surrendered their forms to this gospel. Their legs fuse into gleaming tail-stumps, their jaws stretch into unhinged crescents, and their skin becomes semi-translucent, glowing faintly with the venom that pulses beneath. They no longer speak, only hiss. Their dreams are choruses of writhing shapes beneath a blackened sun.

### Vissathra the Tongueless Prophet's Backstory
Vissathra was once a respected scholar of the arcane, known more for her precision and restraint than for ambition. Fascinated by the remnants of yuan-ti culture, she dedicated her life to deciphering their extinct language—particularly the forbidden verses of the Chant of the First Scales, a serpent-hymn said to predate the written word. For decades, her research was dismissed as esoteric obsession, until one night she cracked a single line. That line did not yield understanding—it exacted a price. Her tongue twisted in agony, then slithered from her mouth of its own volition, hissing as it disappeared into the shadows. What grew in its place was unnatural: a second mouth, nested deep in her throat, which could speak only in the venomous, sibilant tongue of the Eclipse Drakes—an extinct lineage of world-devouring serpents.

This transformation was not the end of her scholarship, but its evolution. Vissathra became the cult’s Oracle, a living conduit for the serpentine future. Her prophecies are not spoken in mortal language; they drip from her lips in thick, black syllables that coil mid-air like smoke before vanishing. When she sleeps, she sheds not hair or tears but scales—smooth, glistening fragments etched with shifting prophetic visions. These scales are alive with meaning and curse. To touch one is to invite something into the mind—a crawling awareness, a whisper of what will be. The scales do not simply reveal the future; they embed it into the soul like venom. Some cultists who have touched them find their skin calcifying into reptilian plates, their hands fusing into claws, their voices hissing with truths they cannot contain. The cult collects these scales and stitches them into cloaks for assassins—living garments that offer glimpses of what’s to come, in exchange for the slow erosion of humanity.

Vissathra’s body is deteriorating, the human shell breaking down as the entity inside swells with power. Her eyes have become slitted, her spine flexible as a snake’s coil, and her dreams are now entirely consumed by the image of the Eclipse Maw—a primordial serpent vast enough to devour the sun itself. Only Xalzithis, the cult's high serpent-priest, has read her final prophecy in full. It foretells the Maw’s awakening and the uncoiling of an age drowned in scales and shadows. Vissathra no longer eats, no longer drinks. She molts more frequently, each shedding more serpentine than the last. Soon, the Oracle will molt for the final time—and what will rise from her coiled husk will not bear a human name.

### Secret
The Eclipse Serpents worship what they believe are divine serpent-gods, but their true purpose is far more sinister—they are unwitting pawns in an ancient prison break. The Eclipse Drakes they revere are not deities, but celestial jailers bound to contain the First Scales, primordial serpents who existed before time and were sealed away for devouring entire realms. The cult's rituals—venomous transformations, eclipse magic, and skin-shedding rites—aren't acts of devotion; they are slowly eroding the cosmic locks holding these elder horrors at bay. The Drakes permit this heresy because they, too, hunger for freedom—even if it means the world will be swallowed whole.
### Hook I
The party is hired by a desperate scholar to steal the Venom Codex from the Temple of the Black Sun, which he claims holds the key to preventing an impending apocalypse. As they infiltrate the temple, they encounter Vissathra, the Tongueless Prophet, who silently warns them in cryptic whispers. Her eyes seem to recognize them, and her voice echoes with knowledge of the future, creating a sense of unsettling déjà vu. The deeper they venture into the temple, the more the adventurers begin to feel the weight of strange, otherworldly forces at work, as though they are not merely thieves, but somehow entwined with the cult’s dark plans.

When they finally reach the Codex, the shocking truth is revealed: the scholar is not who he claimed to be. In reality, he is a future version of Vissathra, sent back in time to ensure the Codex’s survival. The apocalypse she warned of is not the world’s end, but the party’s own transformation. The Codex holds the key to their future selves, and as they interact with it, their memories begin to unravel. They start to understand the serpent-tongue and notice scales appearing on their reflections, signaling that they are changing in ways they cannot control. The Codex is not a tool to stop the apocalypse—it is the cause.

As their bodies and minds slowly succumb to the influence of the Codex, the party realizes with horror that they are not preventing disaster, but instead ensuring it. Their mission has never been to save the world—they are simply delivering the Codex to their future selves, setting the stage for their own dark transformation. The temple’s secrets are not about salvation, but about the inevitable unraveling of time itself. What seemed like a heroic quest is revealed to be a tragic cycle, and the party is caught in its relentless loop, helpless to change their fate.

### Hook II
The beloved heir of a prosperous kingdom returns from a diplomatic mission altered in ways that terrify the court. His skin sheds in ragged patches, revealing the unsettling, scaly surface beneath, and his tongue gradually becomes more serpent-like with each passing month. Despite his growing transformation, the royal family refuses to acknowledge the problem, and the court physician, desperate for answers, turns to the party for help. The kingdom’s future seems at stake, and they must act quickly before the heir’s condition worsens. However, as the party delves deeper into the mystery, they begin to uncover dark truths hidden beneath the palace’s gilded walls.

As the party investigates, they discover the horrifying truth: the prince isn’t being possessed or cursed against his will—he is willingly undergoing this transformation. The cult that has secretly infiltrated the kingdom has promised him godhood, and he has chosen to become the vessel for the resurrection of Xalzithis, an ancient, malevolent deity. Every attempt to "cure" him, whether through holy water, healing magic, or even invasive surgery, only accelerates the prince’s metamorphosis, pushing him closer to his divine transformation. The party is left with an impossible decision: should they kill the prince to halt the ritual and risk plunging the kingdom into civil war, or allow him to complete the transformation and become the new living god of the cult, forever changing the fate of the realm?

The most unsettling revelation comes when they confront the prince. He knows what is happening to him, and he is not distressed. In fact, he welcomes it. He embraces his transformation, eager to shed his mortal form and ascend to a godlike existence. This chilling acceptance reveals that the prince’s thirst for power runs deeper than anyone realized—he is not a victim of manipulation, but an active participant in the cult’s plans. The party is faced with a moral quandary they cannot easily escape: save the kingdom at the cost of a beloved prince’s life, or allow the prince to fulfill his dark destiny and condemn the realm to an uncertain, terrifying future.

**Leadership**: High Chirurgeon Lysander Voss::

**Alignment**: Neutral Evil ::

### Goal
The Creed seeks to create the Magnum Opus Carnis—a living masterpiece composed of every human "flaw" perfected. Their endgame is a single, continent-sized entity stitched from all life, where pain is obsolete and beauty is absolute.
### Ability

When a cultist dies, choose one creature that dealt damage to it this round. They must make a DC 16 Cha save or have their appearance "edited" (random cosmetic change like eye color swap, scarification, or finger elongation).

### Abstract
A cabal of surgeon-artists who worship The Grand Anatomist, a deity of living sculpture, the Fleshweaver’s Creed views flesh as mere clay to be reshaped in pursuit of divine beauty. Their "art" ranges from grotesque living tapestries of stitched-together victims to flawless, reassembled bodies that defy natural limits. Their tools are cursed bone needles and thread spun from sinew, their chapels are operating theaters lined with preserved "masterpieces," and their holy texts are written on flayed skin that still bleeds when read aloud.

:
### Hierarchy
At the pinnacle stands High Chirurgeon Lysander Voss, his word as absolute as a scalpel’s cut. Beneath him labor the Master Artisans, surgeons who have replaced their eyes with gemstones that see only "flaws" to be corrected. The Living Brushes are zealots who have transformed their own bodies into living tools—fingers fused into paintbrushes of bone and hair, tongues elongated into stitching needles. The Canvas Choir comprises the cult’s victims—some willing, most not—kept in drugged stupors as they are reshaped into "art." At the bottom crawl the Unraveled, failed experiments whose bodies reject their grafts, left to writhe in the Gallery of Broken Forms as cautionary displays.

:
### History
The Fleshweaver's Creed began with a single, perfect incision—the first cut of **High Chirurgeon Lysander Voss** upon his own dying sister, **Ophelia the Unmarred**. When plague took her flawless complexion, Lysander refused to let decay claim her beauty. He stitched her skin back together with threads of his own tendons, her corpse rising not as a shambling horror, but as a *living portrait* of her former glory. The townsfolk who came to mourn instead fell to their knees in worship, for Ophelia's reanimated form was more beautiful in death than it had ever been in life.  

Their true power awoke when they uncovered the **Liber Carnis**, a grimoire bound in the skin of a forgotten god of anatomy. Its pages didn't just describe surgical techniques—they *moved*, demonstrating perfect incisions on the reader's own flesh. Their first masterpiece, **The Symphony of Flesh**, transformed an entire monastery into a living organ—each monk's vocal cords tuned to a different note, their ribcages splayed like harp strings that played when the wind passed through. The Creed grew, recruiting surgeons willing to trade their humanity for artistic

 perfection, their bodies slowly becoming living tools—scalpels for fingers, needles for tongues, their very bones reshaped into surgical instruments.  

A faction sought to use the Liber Carnis not just to preserve beauty, but to *create new life*—to sculpt flesh into forms beyond mortal limits. The ensuing **War of Incisions** saw rival chirurgeons weaponizing their art—entire villages were folded into living origami, soldiers unraveled into miles of sinew, and children were grafted together into chimeric "masterpieces." The war ended when Lysander (or what wore his face) appeared in the Grand Atelier and declared *"The Final Cut is made."* The survivors awoke with their eyes sewn open, knowing only that they must **keep sculpting**.  

Their magnum opus—**The Magnum Opus Carnis**—proved their ultimate thesis: *flesh is but clay waiting for the artist's hand*. An entire city's population was disassembled and reassembled into a single, breathing monument that sang with a thousand harmonized voices. By the final suture, only the Creed remained, their hands now permanently fused with their tools.  

Now, they infiltrate hospitals and art academies alike, their **Master Artisans** and **Living Brushes** preparing for the final procedure. Their next masterpiece? **The Godform**, where all life will become one perfect being—and pain will be obsolete.  

### Timeline  
- **Founding Era:** Lysander Voss performs the **First Resurrection** on his sister Ophelia.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Liber Carnis** is unearthed from a celestial cadaver.  
- **Expansion Era:** The Creed establishes "hospitals" that are secret ateliers.  
- **Schism Era:** The **War of Incisions** divides the cult over preservation versus evolution.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The **Magnum Opus Carnis** transforms a city into living art.  
- **Present Era:** The Creed prepares **The Godform**—the ultimate fusion of all flesh.

### Location and Base
A cathedral-sized operating theater suspended above a lake of preservative fluids, its walls "wallpapered" with still-breathing skin canvases that ripple with involuntary muscle twitches. The chandeliers are made of interlocked spinal columns, their candleholders cupped in skeletal hands that drip molten wax onto the surgical tables below. At the center floats the Masterpiece Scaffold, a living, pulsating framework of fused tendons and cartilage where new "art" is grown. The air smells of formaldehyde and rosewater, and the ceiling is a mosaic of preserved faces—each one silently screaming in perfect harmony.
:
### Pecularity
Their "art" is paradoxically beautiful—a gutted man might resemble a blooming rose, a flayed child a choir of porcelain angels. The more horrific the process, the more breathtaking the result.
:
### Public Perception
To nobles, they're visionary artists—their "living portraits" fetch kingdoms' ransoms. To peasants, they're whispered as "the Stitch Men" who steal beautiful children for their galleries. Churches condemn them as heretics, yet their techniques heal wounds no priest can mend. The cult's most terrifying trait is its respectability—their galleries display in royal courts, their members attend high society masked balls, and their "patients" always leave... changed, but grateful. When a village loses its children, the official record states "aesthetic apprenticeships."
:
### Membership
To join is to surrender one's form. The skilled enter as Apprentice Sculptors, trading body parts for surgical tools. The devout become Living Canvases, their flesh reshaped daily in pursuit of perfection. The unwilling are Claystock, kept alive in vats of nutrient-rich blood until needed. All endure the Monthly Exhibition, where failures are "repurposed" into materials—their skin stretched into parchment, their bones carved into needles. The highest ranks, the Grand Anatomists, have transcended flesh entirely, existing as sentient sculptures of floating organs and golden sutures.
:
### Code of Conduct
"The scalpel is our brush, the scream our hymn." The cult operates under the Doctrine of Perfect Form: all flesh must be improved, all suffering must be aesthetic, and no masterpiece may be left unfinished. Their laws are carved directly into initiates' bones—literal "living contracts" that rewrite themselves as the bearer evolves. The highest virtue is "artistic integrity"—the willingness to destroy one's own work and begin anew, no matter how many "drafts" it takes.

### Secret
The Liber Carnis isn't a book—it's the flayed nervous system of a dying god of perfection. Each "page" is a piece of divine anatomy, and every surgery performed feeds the deity's slow resurrection. The cult believes their Magnum Opus Carnis will complete their god's body, but the truth is worse: it will provide a vessel for something far older and hungrier to wear like a skin suit.

## The Liber Carnis 

*Legendary, Requires Attunement (Cursed)*
}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This living grimoire is bound in the still-bleeding skin of the Grand Anatomist's first disciple, its "pages" made from stretched muscle tissue that twitches when read. The surgical diagrams shift and rewrite themselves using the reader's blood as ink, demonstrating perfect incisions on their own flesh as they study. The cover pulses like a slow heartbeat, and the clasps are made of interlocking finger bones that resist being opened by the unworthy.  


\column
#### **Properties**  
- **Surgical Revelation:** As an action, you can perform a procedure from the book. Choose one:  
  - *Flawless Graft:* Attach a severed limb or organ with perfect functionality (even from another creature).  
  - *Anatomical Insight:* Learn a target's exact HP, resistances, and weakest point (next attack crits on 18-20).  
  - *Living Sculpture:* Reshape a willing/restrained creature's physical form (change race, gender, or graft new limbs).  

:
- **Grand Procedure:** Once per long rest, conduct a 1-hour surgery to create a **Flesh Marionette** (see below) from a corpse. The result is always beautiful... and always alive.  

- **Final Incision:** When you would die, your body unravels into surgical threads. You reform at the next full moon from gathered flesh, but lose 1d4 memories of your original life.

### High Chirurgeon Lysander Voss's Backstory
Once, Lysander Voss was lauded as a prodigious physician—renowned for his delicate hands and a mind sharp enough to see the flaws others refused to name. He moved through the courts and infirmaries of the highborn with the quiet assurance of a man who believed medicine to be more than a calling. It was a form of truth. And truth, to Lysander, was anatomy.

His turning point came with a patient of particular beauty: a noblewoman famed for her poise and porcelain skin, marred only by a single, delicate scar across her cheek. To Lysander, it was an imperfection that insulted the very concept of symmetry. He "corrected" it—without consent—by grafting flawless skin from a dozen beggars onto her face, using techniques he had not yet dared write down. When she awoke, screaming at the grotesque chimera he had made of her, he felt no guilt. Only disappointment.

It was not the act that was flawed, he realised—it was memory. If she had never known herself before, she might have thanked him. That night, as he brooded beneath the bone-lamps of his private theatre, something answered. A voice, cool and precise, whispered from the depths of the blood-soaked tiles: The Grand Anatomist. It taught him the First Flesh Hymn, a chant not sung but incised, each verse etched in scalpel strokes, each note measured in nerve and sinew. Pain ceased to be an obstacle. Flesh bent. Bone obeyed.

Lysander disappeared from polite society soon after, but his legend only grew. Now, his own body is a masterpiece of monstrous refinement. His face is a seamless mosaic of harvested beauty—cheekbones from lovers, brows from martyrs, lips from dreamers—and his fingers can extend into surgical tools with a thought. His ribcage no longer protects—it displays, opening like a reliquary to reveal preserved organs and ossified wonders, each one a study in holy suffering.

To his followers—the Fleshweaver’s Creed—he is the Scalpel-Saint, the Prophet of Perfected Form. He preaches in amphitheatres lined with flayed skin, where pain is silence and incisions are scripture. He teaches that agony is not cruelty, but the chisel of the divine. Enlightenment, he claims, can only be found when the body is unmade and remade—the old shape flensed away to reveal what the soul should have been.

His great project—the Magnum Opus Carnis—has already begun. A city selected, not razed but harvested. He sees it not as a place, but as a raw form waiting to be sculpted. Buildings will become bones, streets will stretch like veins, and people—still living—will become organs in a single, perfect, breathing monument to the Grand Anatomist. A final testament of surgical divinity, carved not in stone, but in flesh.

### Sister Gethsemane the Unstitched's Backstory
Born with a rare condition that left her skin loose like ill-fitting cloth, Gethsemane was abandoned at a Fleshweaver orphanage. The cult saw her not as a victim, but as a blank canvas—they spent her childhood grafting experimental tissues onto her, leaving her a mosaic of mismatched flesh that should not have survived. But survive she did, and worse: her body began to remember every graft, every donor. Now, she sits in a chapel of suspended animation, her skin constantly peeling away to reveal prophetic messages forming in the muscle beneath.

The cult "reads" her by carefully flaying sections of her flesh, which regrow within hours. Her prophecies are terrifyingly literal—when she whispered of "a king’s heart in a beggar’s chest," the cult kidnapped a monarch and transplanted his still-beating organ into a starving poet. Her most horrifying secret? She is not one woman, but hundreds—every piece of grafted flesh retains the consciousness of its original owner, and they all scream through her mouth when the moon is full.

{{note
### Additional Notes For GMs
The cult sees violence as "crude sculpting." Describe wounds as "improvements," and have enemies prioritize "fixing" the most attractive PCs first.

### Hook I
The party is summoned by the distraught Duke of Velmire, whose daughter Lady Seraphina vanished after visiting the renowned "Atelier of Divine Forms." What begins as a simple missing person case takes a dark turn when they discover the Atelier's front door is made of interlocking human jaws that part only for those "seeking improvement." Inside, the air smells of lavender and iron, and the walls are lined with living portraits - nobles frozen mid-scream, their stretched skin serving as canvases for glowing anatomical diagrams.


As they delve deeper, the party finds Seraphina in the Grand Studio, her body transformed into a grotesque chandelier - her ribs splayed outward holding candle-flames that burn without consuming her flesh. The High Chirurgeon explains this is her "ascension," that she begged to become eternal art. The Liber Carnis lies open, its pages now showing the party's own bodies deconstructed into potential masterpieces. Worse, some PCs may recognize faces in the gallery - people they knew who disappeared years ago, preserved in states of perfect torment.


At midnight, the gallery comes alive. Not to attack, but to perform - the sculptures reenact their moments of transformation in an endless loop. Seraphina's voice emerges from all of them simultaneously, begging the party to either complete her masterpiece (requiring a volunteer) or take her place. The walls begin bleeding surgical tools, and the true horror is revealed: the entire building is a living entity, its floorboards fused vertebrae, its chandeliers still-breathing nerve clusters.

### Hook II
The fishing town of Brinewatch has become a pilgrimage site since the arrival of "Doctor Calliope," a masked surgeon who cures any deformity. The party arrives to find disturbing perfection - every citizen shares the same hauntingly beautiful features, their original faces displayed in the "Hall of Gratitude." Children with golden sutures skip through streets that smell like embalming fluid. The town priest, Father Dain, is the sole dissenter - he wears a blood-soaked burlap sack over his head after clawing off his own face to stop the whispers.


During the nightly "Enhancement Ceremony," the party witnesses the truth: Calliope isn't a person, but a swarm of silver needles controlled by the Liber Carnis. Townsfolk queue willingly as their faces are peeled back and remade, chanting hymns to the Grand Anatomist. Those who resist are taken to the "Composition Room" where the Living Brushes work - not to punish, but to "help them understand." The book itself floats above an altar of fused hands, its pages filled with moving illustrations of the party's potential transformations.


The cult's endgame is revealed - the entire town is being prepared as a "living mask" for something sleeping beneath the waves. Each perfected face brings it closer to awakening. Destroying the Liber Carnis would free the town... but release 347 stored "corrections" in a catastrophic flesh-storm. The church bells begin ringing with a sound like screaming as the townsfolk's faces start melting into a single, terrible visage - the Godform's first feature pushing through reality.

### Encounter table
| Roll | Encounter | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **The Willing Canvas** | 1d4+1 devotees beg the party to "improve" them (-2 penalty to resist their requests). Each carries a self-made incision kit and list of desired "enhancements." |
| 2 | **Living Gallery** | A hallway of "art pieces" - people fused into furniture. One whispers for help; assisting triggers a Flesh Marionette ambush from the walls. |
| 3 | **Surgical Sanctum** | An operating theater where 2d6 cultists perform on "volunteers." Interrupting causes the patients to attack, believing the party are "heretics against beauty." |
| 4 | **The Grand Anatomist's Gaze** | A statue with the High Chirurgeon's face watches from multiple angles. Those who meet its eyes must save vs. a random "cosmetic adjustment." |
| 5 | **Harvesting Party** | 1d4 Living Brushes collecting "materials" from a recent battle. They'll offer 500gp per intact corpse... and take offense if refused. |
| 6 | **The Liber Carnis' Whispers** | The book appears floating in midair, open to a page showing a PC's "perfect form." Touching it deals 2d6 psychic damage but reveals a crucial secret. |

**Leadership**: High Exchequer Valmire the Gilded::

### Goal
The Gilded Serpent seeks to transmute suffering into capital on a cosmic scale. Their grand design, the Magnum Opus Economica, aims to concentrate all wealth into the Chalice of Midas until it overflows—triggering an alchemical apotheosis where gold becomes the only universal law. In this new order, the worthy (those with "liquidity") will ascend as immortal shareholders in reality itself, while the indebted (everyone else) will become literal currency—minted, traded, and spent.
### Ability

As a bonus action, a Gilded Serpent member can mark a creature they can see as a Debtor. For the next hour:

Interest Accumulation: Whenever the Debtor takes damage, they take an additional 1d6 necrotic damage per 10 gp worth of valuables they carry.

Collateral Seizure: If the Debtor dies, their most valuable item teleports into the cultist’s hands. Magical items require a DC 16 Charisma save to resist.

Credit Score: The cultist gains temporary HP equal to half the Debtor’s lost HP (rounded down).

### Abstract
A cabal of merchant-kings and bankers who worship wealth as a literal divine force, the Gilded Serpent operates from gilded temples hidden in plain sight—opulent trading halls, private auction houses, and the vaults of fallen kingdoms. Their sacrament? The Chalice of Midas, a cursed relic that transmutes the blood of the "unworthy" (read: poor) into liquid gold. To them, poverty isn’t misfortune—it’s heresy, and their "alms" are the knives that carve the starving into bullion.

Their grand design? To gild the world—to remake society into a pyramid where the wealthy ascend to literal divinity, their veins flowing with aureate ichor, while the destitute are rendered down into currency. The cult’s enforcers, the Golden Scales, stalk slums and debtor’s prisons, "recruiting" for the next Transmutation Ceremony, where screams are drowned out by the clinking of coins.

:
### Hierarchy
At the apex coils High Exchequer Valmire the Gilded, his word as binding as a signed ledger. Directly beneath him slither the Aureate Syndics, merchant-lords who oversee regional "markets" (read: sacrificial districts). The Golden Scales act as enforcers—part banker, part inquisitor—auditing slums for "liquidation candidates." Coin-Tongued Proselytizers seduce the middle class into complicity with promises of wealth, while the Debtors' Choir, the lowest rank, are indentured souls working to "repay" the cult for the sin of their poverty. At the bottom writhe the Gilding Pools, mass graves where the unworthy are rendered into gold, their screams muffled by the clink of coins.

:
### History
The Gilded Serpent began with a single, unforgivable transaction—the sale of **Saint Marchelle the Almsgiver** to debtor's prison by her own brother, the merchant-lord **Valentio di Valturi**. When she died clutching only a copper coin in that filthy cell, the coin melted in Valentio's palm and reformed as the first **Numisma**, whispering the Chalice's location. He found it in the ruins of a temple to a forgotten god of greed, where the altar was an inverted scale forever tipping toward "profit."  

Their true power awoke when Valentio poured his sister's remaining blood into the Chalice—it didn't just make gold, it made *better gold*. Each ingot bore Marchelle's face, and spending it caused the recipient to forget an act of kindness. The first **Great Liquidation** emptied six debtor's prisons in a night, producing enough

 "capital" to buy a duke's title. The cult grew, recruiting bankers who worshipped at the altar of compound interest, their eyes gradually filming over with gold leaf as they ascended the ranks. The poorest became literal investments, their life expectancies calculated down to the hour before being rendered into currency.  

A faction sought to use the Chalice not just for wealth, but to **redefine value itself**—to create a world where love, art, and morality had measurable exchange rates. The ensuing **War of Revaluation** saw economic warfare made literal: crops rotted in seconds as their "market value" plummeted, soldiers turned on their lords over whispered bid prices, and an entire city's population became "inflation-proof" by being transmuted into a single diamond. The war ended when Valentio (or something wearing his ledger) appeared in the Grand Bourse and declared *"Equilibrium Achieved"*—every survivor's net worth was suddenly, perfectly balanced to zero.  

Their magnum opus—**The Magnum Opus Economica**—proved their ultimate thesis: *poverty could be eradicated by erasing the poor*. An entire slum district became a single, self-replenishing gold ingot that grew heavier with each beggar "processed." By the final audit, only the Serpent's accountants remained, their abacuses clicking like prayer beads.  

Now, they infiltrate treasuries and orphanages alike, their **Golden Scales** and **Aureate Syndics** preparing for the **Final Dividend**—when all life will be assessed, appraised, and either "retained" or "liquidated."  



### Timeline  
- **Founding Era:** Valentio di Valturi sacrifices his sister to create the first Numisma.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Chalice of Compound Interest** is unearthed beneath a ruined temple.  
- **Expansion Era:** The Serpent establishes "debtor sanctuaries" that are really gilding factories.  
- **Schism Era:** The **War of Revaluation** fractures the cult over ethics versus profit.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The **Magnum Opus Economica** erases an entire district's poverty by erasing its people.  
- **Present Era:** The Serpent prepares the **Final Dividend**—a global financial reckoning.  

### Location and Base
A monolithic bank-fortress floating atop a lake of molten gold, its foundations built from the compressed remains of bankrupt kingdoms. The vault doors are sealed with blood-contracts that burn the hands of the unworthy, while the interior is a labyrinth of gilded corridors where the walls whisper stock prices in dead languages. At its heart pulses the Chalice of Compound Interest, a self-replenishing font that transmutes liquidated debtors into gold ingots stamped with their screaming faces. The air thrums with the sound of invisible auctions, and time itself bends around profit margins—visitors often exit to find years have passed, or that they've unknowingly signed away their organs in fine print. Phantom brokers drift through

the halls, their bodies composed of coin-shards, forever arguing over the value of human souls.
:
### Pecularity
The Serpent’s most unsettling trait is its perverse generosity. It "gifts" gold freely—coins that always bear tiny faces of past victims in their relief. These "investments" multiply in value but demand escalating interest: first memories, then loved ones, finally years of life. The poorest are "granted mercy" by being transmuted first, their bodies becoming the cult’s operating capital. Even their rituals parody commerce: sacrifices are "liquidations," altars are "vaults," and prayers are "compound interest calculations" hummed in the tongue of dead economies.
:
### Public Perception
To the elite, the Serpent is a "fraternal order of financiers"—eccentric but respectable. Peasants whisper of "gold-fevered ghouls" who buy children for "apprenticeships" that leave them hollow-eyed and coin-filled. Churches condemn them as heretics, yet their vaults bulge with Serpent-donated tithes. The cult’s most terrifying trait is its banality: its brokers wear tailored suits, not robes, and its crimes are filed as "tax adjustments." When a village vanishes, the ledgers simply note "assets consolidated."
:
### Membership
To join is to accept the Golden Brand, a searing mark that converts flesh into an interest-bearing asset. The wealthy enter as Investors, trading souls like stock. The skilled become Assayers, testing the purity of suffering in transmutation rituals. The desperate sell themselves as Liquid Assets, their bodies collateral for loans that can never be repaid. All endure the Quarterly Reckoning, where underperformers are "restructured"—flayed alive and their skin repurposed as ledger pages. The highest ranks, the Aureate Syndics, replace their organs with gold replicas, their hearts beating in time with market fluctuations.
:
### Code of Conduct
"Profit is piety, and debt is sin." The cult operates under an unbreakable mercantile doctrine: all actions must yield measurable returns, all relationships are transactional, and poverty is the only true heresy. Contracts are sacred—written in blood-ink on human parchment—and breaking one warrants liquidation. Members must tithe 30% of their wealth weekly, but the true cost is moral: each donation erases a memory of compassion, replaced by the serene certainty that suffering is just "unrealized potential." The highest virtue is "alchemical thrift"—extracting maximum value from every resource, especially human ones.

#####  Lady Numisma the Broken Mint
{margin-left:-12px}
:::::::::
### Secret
The Chalice isn’t a tool—it’s a prison. The molten gold within is the still-living remains of Saint Marchelle, the so-called "Almsgiver" whose martyrdom birthed the first Numisma. Her divine essence acts as an alchemical filter, turning cruelty into currency. The cult’s entire operation is her slow crucifixion; every ingot minted flakes away fragments of her sanctity. Should the Chalice ever be emptied completely, Marchelle’s restored form would unleash a Jubilee Wave—a divine reset erasing all debt, undoing every transmutation, and reducing the Serpent’s hoards to worthless lead. The Golden Scales quietly execute anyone who notices the face in the gold is always weeping.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## The Chalice of Midas

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster or noble-born creature)*
}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
Crafted from cursed electrum and adorned with writhing serpent motifs, the Chalice of Midas radiates an unsettling warmth. Its bowl is always half-full with a golden liquid that never spills—until blood is added. Ornate inscriptions in ancient tongues spiral down the stem, translating into a single phrase: *"Value is measured in suffering."* When held, the chalice vibrates faintly in the presence of impoverished or desperate individuals.

\column
#### **Properties**

* **Alchemical Transmutation:** As an action, the attuned user may cause the chalice to transmute a vial (or equivalent volume) of humanoid blood into pure liquid gold worth 250 gp. This can be done up to three times per day. If the blood belonged to a creature with no wealth or status (as determined by the DM), the gold is cursed—see **Gilded Damnation** below.
* **Tithe of Ascension:** When a creature is sacrificed using the chalice (killed and their blood poured directly into it), the attuned gains temporary hit points equal to the creature’s total wealth in gold pieces (DM’s discretion). Once per long rest.
* **Golden Benediction:** As an action, the wielder can spend 100 gp (poured into the chalice) to cast *Greater Restoration* or *Remove Curse* without components. The wealth is consumed in the casting. This ability can be used twice per long rest.

### High Exchequer Valmire the Gilded's Backstory
Valmire’s story began in the gutter-stink of the Grasping Maw, the worst slum in the merchant-city of Aurantis. Born to a debt-whore mother who sold her teeth for bread, he learned early that gold was the only god worth kneeling to. As a child, he survived by crawling beneath the tables of gambling dens, licking spilled wine and gold dust from noblemen’s boots. His first memory was the taste of gilded leather—bitter and metallic, like hope. By twelve, he’d learned to pick pockets with a razor; by fifteen, he sold his own mother’s corpse to a mortician for half a silver. But it wasn’t enough. He wanted to own the boots.

His ascent began when he uncovered the Chalice of Midas in the vaults of Lord Antherion, a bankrupt aristocrat who’d hanged himself from his own chandelier. The Chalice was tarnished then, its surface black with age—until Valmire, half-starved and delirious, slit a rival thief’s throat over it. The blood hit the cup… and sang. The liquid hardened into a perfect, uncanny gold coin bearing the dead man’s screaming face. Valmire laughed—a sound that turned to choked awe as the Chalice whispered its first commandment: "More." Within a year, he owned Antherion’s manor. Within five, he owned the district.

Now, Valmire is no longer a man, but a theorem of greed made flesh. His sermons in the Temple of the Open Palm draw merchants and murderers alike, all eager to kiss the Chalice’s rim. His "blessings" are transactions—a widow’s tears become a necklace, an orphan’s laughter a ring. His grand ritual, the Great Revaluation, nears completion: a symphony of screaming markets and bursting veins that will transmute the city’s "worthless" masses into a single, flawless ingot—a "monument to prosperity" that will elevate him to godhood. But the Chalice murmurs truths in his gilded dreams: it has had many bearers, all convinced they controlled it. It shows him visions of past "Exchequers"—their gold-fused skeletons still praying in hidden vaults, their mouths stretched into eternal, rictus smiles. The Chalice is not a relic. It is a parasite, and Valmire is merely its latest host.

###  Lady Numisma the Broken Mint's Backstory
Once the brightest jewel of the capital’s courtesan circles, Numisma was renowned not just for her beauty, but for her voice—a hypnotic contralto that could soothe riots or spark rebellions with a single ballad. Noblemen fought duels over the privilege of her company, and poets declared her songs "more precious than a kingdom’s treasury." But her fatal mistake was mocking the advances of Lord Exchequer Valmire himself, sneering at his marriage proposal with a laugh that echoed through the Grand Bourse. In retaliation, the Gilded Serpent dragged her to their sanctum and punished her in the holiest way they knew: they forced open her jaw and poured molten gold down her throat, intent on turning her most prized asset into their sacrament.

But gold has its own will. Instead of choking, Numisma sang—a single, piercing note that made the Chalice of Midas shiver in its shrine. The liquid metal fused with her vocal cords, weaving through her ribs like gilded filigree, transforming her into something neither alive nor dead, but valuable. Now, her every utterance carries the weight of prophecy, though none are kind. When she whispers, coins tremble in purses across the city, rolling toward her like devoted pets. When she screams, gold ingots leap from vaults as if trying to return to her flesh. The cult keeps her suspended in a gilded cage at the heart of their treasury, where the weight of stolen wealth presses down on her from all sides. Chains of solid coin-weight bind her wrists, each link stamped with the face of someone she once knew.

Her prophecies are traded as currency—literally. Every word she speaks condenses into a blood-warm coin called a "Numisma," each bearing her agonized profile. These coins grant uncanny financial fortune (reroll a failed Charisma or Deception check once per day), but each use erases the holder’s memory of hardship—first recollections of hunger, then memories of loved ones who struggled, and eventually, the very concept of empathy. The Serpent’s brokers trade them in shadow markets, but the coins always find their way back to Numisma, piling up beneath her cage like offerings to a starving god. The heavier the pile grows, the louder the other voices in her head become—the screams of those already rendered into gold, begging her to sing them back into existence.

### Additional Notes For GMs
"The Gilded Serpent doesn’t fight fair—they litigate. Play them like a predatory bank: offer ‘loans’ (healing with strings attached), call in favors at the worst moments, and always have an escape clause (e.g., a Dimension Door scroll disguised as a contract). Their true power isn’t in gold, but in making the party complicit—every coin they spend from the cult’s vault should come with hidden terms."

Tactical Tip: Have Syndics "foreclose" on downed PCs—offering revivification in exchange for signing a Soulbond Contract (disadvantage on saves vs. the cult thereafter).

}}
### Hook I
A desperate merchant hires the party to investigate a series of bizarre bank heists—not gold or jewels are being stolen, but debt ledgers. The vaults are left untouched except for the incineration of loan documents, and witnesses report hearing ghostly singing as the papers burn. The trail leads to a splinter faction of the Gilded Serpent called the Silver Tongues, who believe true wealth lies in erasing all debt. Their leader, a disgraced banker named Lysander the Unbound, claims to have found a way to reverse the Chalice’s alchemy—but only if they sacrifice someone who has never owed a single coin.

The party soon learns the Silver Tongues are hunting Marchelle’s Last Heir, a mute orphan whose blood can trigger the Jubilee Wave. The child hides in the ruins of a debtor’s church, guarded by Forgiven Wraiths—spirits of those who died debt-free. But the Gilded Serpent has already infiltrated the city guard, rewriting laws to make poverty itself a capital crime. Time is running out: at the next lunar eclipse, Lysander plans to drown the child in the Chalice to cleanse all debt... unaware this will also unleash Marchelle’s vengeful spirit upon the world.

Twist: The orphan is the reincarnated Saint Marchelle. Freeing her could collapse the economy—but stopping Lysander means preserving the Serpent’s tyranny.

### Hook II
Aureate Syndic invites them to bid at an exclusive auction where the lots include:

A vial of Dragon’s Credit (liquid luck that evaporates if used selflessly)

A Soulbond Locket (stores a loved one’s memories—but consumes their lifespan)

The Last Breath of a Kingdom (a bottled sigh that inflicts mass suggestion when released)

The venue? A sinking pleasure barge where the floors are glass, revealing drowning prisoners below whose struggles determine each lot’s "starting price." The Syndic smiles as he explains the true currency: "No gold tonight, my friends. We trade in... favors." Every bid compels the bidder to fulfill a hidden contract (e.g., "Deliver a rival’s head," "Burn down an orphanage"). Refusal triggers the Breach of Contract Geas, turning the bidder into a lot themselves.

Mid-auction, a Coin-Tongued Proselytizer slips the  
party a note: "The final lot is YOU." The auction is a  
trap to harvest high-value "assets." The barge isn’t sinking—it’s a transmutation crucible, and the drowning prisoners are the fuel. To escape, the party must outbid the Syndic using something he can’t quantify: a memory of true selflessness. But offering one risks leaving them hollow enough to be Serpent material...

Twist: The auction’s staff are all former winners who chose to stay, their personalities erased by repetitive bidding. The only way out is to bankrupt the Syndic—by proving something (love? honor?) has infinite value.

| 2    | **The Liquid Asset**  | A **Goldborn Wretch** (humanoid with skin splitting to reveal molten gold) staggers toward the party, begging for help.

| 3    | **The Compound Interest** | A hallway where every step makes coins materialize underfoot. After 10 steps, the party must make a DC 16 CHA save or gain *Gold Fever*: compulsively pick up coins (disadvantage on attacks/checks while not holding gold). The coins bear their own faces. |  
| 4    | **The Silent Shareholder**   | A gilded corpse in a broker’s suit sits at a desk, its chest cavity hollowed out to hold a ticking brass abacus. Solving its riddle (“*What is the value of a scream?*”) stops the ticking. Wrong answers deal 1d6 psychic damage per tick (max 10d6). |  
| 5    | **The Hostile Takeover** | A **Aureate Syndic** (gold-masked banker) offers a *“risk-free investment”*—signing a contract in blood-ink. Signers gain 100 gp but must repay 1d4 memories (randomly erased) at dawn. Refusers are attacked by 2d6 **Coin Golems** made of contract scraps. |  
| 6    | **The Final Dividend**      | A vault filled with gold statues of previous adventurers, all frozen mid-scream. Touching any triggers a **Wealth Echo** (DC 18 WIS save or reroll your next roll twice and take the worst result). The Chalice sits on a pedestal... but the floor is a *pressure plate* rigged to liquefy all metal in the room. |

{{OrgName
## The Glass-Eyed Seers
}}
:::
{{monster,orgstat
{{columns:2,statpart1



**Leadership**: High Augur Sylas the shatered::

**Alignment**: True Neutral::

}}
---
### Goal
The Glass-Eyed Seers seek to unsee the lie of existence—to strip away the illusions of mortal perception and witness the raw, unfiltered truth of the cosmos. They believe reality is a facade, a "veil" cast by some primordial intelligence to shield lesser beings from the unbearable totality of the void. Their rituals involve self-blinding, sensory deprivation, and the ingestion of hallucinogenic inks that allow them to "read" the patterns of fate etched into the air itself. Their ultimate aim is to locate the Ocular Key, a relic said to be the first "eye" that ever opened in the universe, which they believe will grant them omniscience—or reduce them to screaming, enlightened husks.
### Ability

A Seer can share a vision with another creature (DC 16 Wis save or suffer its effects).  



}}

\column
::::::::::

### Abstract
The Glass-Eyed Seers believe true sight is a lie—that mortal eyes filter reality, shielding the mind from the unbearable truth of existence. To pierce this veil, they ritually blind themselves, replacing their eyes with polished obsidian orbs that channel visions from beyond the stars. These "gifts" come at a terrible price: each prophecy fractures their sanity further, warping their perception of time, space, and self. Their sacred texts are etched in braille on human skin, their rituals conducted in absolute darkness, and their prophecies whispered in languages that twist the listener’s tongue. They seek the Ocular Key, a legendary artifact said to unseal the universe’s hidden design—but their own visions warn that finding it may unravel reality itself.

:
### Hierarchy
The Glass-Eyed Seers are structured like a collapsing star—dense, unstable, and pulling all toward a singular, terrible truth. At the center stands High Augur Sylas, the shatered, whose fractured mind navigates the cult through visions no other can fully comprehend. Beneath him are the Eclipse Choir, blind prophets who interpret Sylas’s ramblings into actionable dogma, their own obsidian eyes weeping black tears as they scry the edges of reality. The Lensbearers serve as both scholars and enforcers, maintaining the cult’s archives of skin-bound prophecies while ensuring none stray from the path of revelation, even if that means carving out the eyes of the unworthy. The lowest tier, the Penumbral Acolytes, are newly blinded initiates who spend their days in silent meditation, learning to "see" through the whispers of the void. Unlike other cults, there is no rivalry within the ranks—all are united in their shared madness, their hierarchy fluid as the visions that guide them. They communicate through touch, their fingers tracing braille warnings on each other’s flesh, their sanctuaries built without light, for in darkness, they believe, the truth is brightest.

:
### History
The Glass-Eyed Seers began with a single, unbearable vision—the last sight of **High Augur Sylas the shatered** before he tore out his own eyes. Once a revered astronomer, Sylas had spent decades mapping the heavens, until the night he witnessed the **Black Eclipse**, a celestial anomaly that blotted out the stars and left only a vast, lidless eye staring back from the void. When daylight returned, Sylas was found curled around his telescope, his eye sockets empty, whispering of "the lie behind the sky."

##### The Observatory of Unseen Truths

He claimed the cosmos was a facade, that the true universe was a sentient darkness watching them all—and that mortal sight was a prison.  

Their true power awoke when they discovered the **Weeping Mirror**, a pool of liquid silver hidden beneath a ruined observatory. The Mirror did not reflect—it *revealed*, showing every possible future, every splintered version of reality, all at once. Those who gazed into it saw themselves as they might have been, could be, or never were, their minds buckling under the weight of infinite truths. The Seers' first act of devotion was to blind themselves, replacing their eyes with obsidian lenses that let them peer beyond the veil without going mad. Their first miracle, the **Rite of shatered Sight**, granted a dying king visions of all his possible deaths—he chose the most glorious, and his corpse still stands in their halls, frozen in ecstatic rigor mortis.  

A faction sought to use the Mirror not just to see the future, but to *unmake* it—to shatter the chains of destiny and let reality collapse into pure potential. The ensuing **Schism of a Thousand Visions** saw rival prophets weaponizing paradoxes—entire bloodlines blinked out when ancestors were erased from time, cities became palimpsests of conflicting histories, and the sky itself fractured like broken glass. The war ended when Sylas (or something wearing his face) stepped into the Mirror and emerged with his body half-transformed into quicksilver, his voice now speaking in perfect unison with all his possible selves. The survivors awoke with their memories rewritten, knowing only that they must **keep searching**.  

Their magnum opus—**The Dreaming Plague**—proved their ultimate thesis: *blindness was enlightenment*. They infected an entire city with visions that dissolved their eyes into glass orbs, leaving them able to see the filaments of fate, the hollow spaces between moments, the whispering lies of the universe. By the plague's end, only the Seers remained, their minds now open vessels for truths no mortal was meant to know.  

Now, they wander the world as living prophecies, their **Eclipse Choir** and **Lensbearers** carving out eyes and etching revelations onto human skin. Their next revelation? The **Ocular Key**, which will unseal the first eye that ever opened—and, in doing so, close all others forever.  

### Timeline
- **Founding Era:** Sylas the shatered blinds himself after the **Black Eclipse**.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Weeping Mirror** is unearthed beneath the ruins of the First Observatory.  
- **Expansion Era:** The Seers spread the **Rite of shatered Sight** to nobles and kings.  
- **Schism Era:** The **Schism of a Thousand Visions** fractures the cult over destiny versus chaos.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The **Dreaming Plague** transforms an entire city into glass-eyed oracles.  
- **Present Era:** The Seers seek the **Ocular Key**—the first and last eye of creation.

### Location and Base
Carved into the heart of a dead volcano, the Observatory is a spiraling descent into madness. Its walls are lined with the petrified bodies of past Seers, their hollow eye sockets filled with pulsating black crystals that hum in discordant harmony. The air is thick with the scent of burnt ozone and the metallic tang of the inks they use to transcribe visions—inks made from their own vitreous fluid, mixed with crushed meteorites. The central chamber houses the Refraction Pool, a liquid mirror that shows not reflections, but splintered fragments of alternate realities. Those who gaze into it see themselves as they might have been, could be, or never were, often with horrific consequences.

Beneath the Observatory lies the Choir of Silence, a pitch-black cavern where the Seers gather to "listen" to the universe. Here, they sit motionless for days, their obsidian eyes weeping viscous black tears that pool into a subterranean lake. The lake’s surface is perfectly still—until a prophecy strikes, sending ripples across the water that form intricate, living patterns. Some say the lake is the cult’s true oracle, and the Seers are merely its interpreters.
:
### Pecularity
The Seers' most disturbing trait is their Shared Dreams. When one member receives a vision, fragments of it bleed into the minds of all others who have ritually blinded themselves. These visions manifest as phantom sensations—a Seer might suddenly taste copper while another feels their skin crack like porcelain, all experiencing different facets of the same prophecy. Over time, their collective hallucinations warp the spaces they inhabit; their sanctuaries become labyrinths of impossible geometry, walls whispering in languages that don't exist, shadows moving with sentient hunger. Outsiders who spend too long among them report losing time, finding unfamiliar scars on their bodies, or briefly seeing through the eyes of something else.
:
### Public Perception
To outsiders, the Glass-Eyed Seers are either pitiable madmen or dangerous heretics—their self-mutilation seen as the ultimate rejection of the gods' gifts. Villagers leave offerings of black cloth and ink at crossroads to ward off their prophecies, while scholars debate whether their visions are divine truths or the ravings of diseased minds. This suits the Seers perfectly. Their greatest protection is the Law of the Unbelieved: by making their very existence seem like a folktale, they ensure no one interferes with their work. Those who learn too much are rarely killed—instead, they're given a "glimpse" of what the Seers see, after which they either join the cult or spend their lives screaming about eyes in the dark.

##### The Weeping Mirror
{margin-left:-12px}
:::::::::

### Membership
The Seers recruit from three pools: the Broken (those who have lost everything and seek meaning in the void), the Cursed (victims of supernatural visions they cannot unsee), and the Hungry (scholars who traded sanity for knowledge). Initiates undergo the Rite of the New Blind, where their eyes are removed with a ceremonial silver spoon heated in starfall-metal flames. The highest ranks, the Oracles of the Cracked Lens, have their empty sockets fitted with slivers of the Oculus Maledictus itself, granting them visions that physically warp their bodies—spines curve into question-mark shapes, tongues bifurcate to "taste" lies, and some grow extra eyelids that blink in sync with distant stars.

## The Ocular Key  

*Legendary, Requires Attunement (Cursed)*  

}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This spiraling iris-shaped relic is forged from solidified void-stuff, its surface shifting between obsidian black and nacreous white. When held near an empty eye socket, it twists like a living thing, eager to be implanted. Once inserted, it fuses with the skull, granting visions of cosmic truth - and unraveling the user's sanity thread by thread.  

\column

#### **Properties**  
- **True Sight:** Gain truesight 120 ft. and see through all illusions, but reality becomes increasingly fractured (Disadvantage on Wisdom saves).  
- **The Unblinking Gaze:** As an action, force a creature to confront an unfiltered truth (DC 18 Wis save or take 6d6 psychic damage and gain a madness).  
- **Eclipse Revelation:** Once per long rest, ask one question about the future. The GM answers truthfully - but implementing this knowledge warps fate (e.g., avoiding a death may cause a worse one).  
- **Final Truth:** Upon death, your body petrifies into a hollow-eyed statue that whispers prophecies to passersby.

### High Augur Sylas the shatered's Backstory
Sylas was once a man of reason, a celebrated astronomer whose name adorned the finest observatories in the empire. His star charts were works of art, his lectures crowded with scholars and nobility alike. He spoke of order in the heavens, of divine mathematics, of patterns that foretold the changing of seasons and fates. His life was defined by the pursuit of cosmic certainty—until the night of the Black Eclipse.

It was not a predicted event. No alignment accounted for it. No telescope captured it fully. For three minutes, the sky turned to ink. The stars vanished—not dimmed, not hidden—but obliterated, as if they had never been. In their place: eyes. Vast, lidless, unblinking. Watching.

When the eclipse passed, Sylas was found collapsed beneath his telescope, his eyes clawed from his own skull, blood painting constellations across the marble floor. He babbled about “the lie of the sky,” weeping joyfully as he declared that he had finally seen the truth: the universe was not a great machine, but a sentient veil, and it had noticed him.

He was committed, of course. For a time. But institutions falter when whispers grow. First came the desperate—the blind, the forgotten, the broken—drawn to the madman who spoke of truth beyond sight. Then came the curious, seeking hidden knowledge. And finally, the fanatics, who called themselves the Glass-Eyed, and named Sylas their Prophet Unseeing.

It was Sylas who created the first rite, piercing his ruined sockets and inserting twin lenses of black meteorite, polished until they reflected nothing. With them, he saw visions: fractured timelines, alternate lives, dream-hung realities where suns were prey and planets screamed. The more he saw, the less of him remained. Time began to treat him as a suggestion—his form flickering between youth and age, his voice sometimes echoing with his unborn self.

He no longer speaks plainly. His sermons are riddles, sentences that contradict themselves, truths wrapped in paradox. One moment he proclaims his own apotheosis; the next, he weeps for a future where he becomes nothing but static, screaming at the end of time. His followers hang on every word, transcribing gibberish as scripture. To them, madness is not a failing—it is the first stage of clarity.

His final vision came in a storm of blood and starlight. He saw the Ocular Key—a relic formed of void-stuff, buried in the ruins of a civilization that never existed. A spiralling iris that sees not with light, but through absence. Sylas believes it will show him the Moment Before, the instant before the universe awoke, when all was still and blind. He calls it the True Dawn, the final unveiling.

### The Weeping Mirror's Backstory
No one remembers the Oracle’s original name—if it ever had one. It was found in a forgotten shrine, its face a featureless slab of polished silver, its body emaciated and bound in chains of frozen mercury. When the Seers brought it before Sylas, the silver face split open like a weeping wound, and it spoke with the voices of everyone who had ever looked into it.

The Weeping Mirror does not predict the future—it reflects it, showing every possible outcome simultaneously. Those who gaze into its surface see countless versions of themselves living, dying, and becoming things not human. The visions are not metaphorical; the Mirror’s silver is a living thing, a substance from beyond reality that reshapes the viewer’s flesh to match what they see. Some emerge with extra limbs, their skin patterned with alien script. Others return with their faces erased, their features smoothed into blank silver.

The cult keeps the Mirror in a pitch-black chamber, its chains bolted to the floor with nails made of calcified tears. It is both revered and feared, for while its prophecies are infallible, the price for asking is always a piece of the seeker’s identity. Sylas consults it only in moments of crisis, and each time he does, a little more of him comes back... wrong. The last time, he returned with his left hand transformed into quicksilver, the fingers constantly melting and reforming into tiny, screaming faces.

### Additional Notes For GMs
The Seers always seem prepared because they are - but their visions are fragmented. Use this to foreshadow without giving solutions

}}
### Code of Conduct
The Seers live by the Doctrine of the Unseen: no truth may be spoken aloud unless first carved in braille upon living flesh, and no member may interfere with the visions they receive—even if they foresee their own demise. Communication occurs through touch alone, fingers tracing warnings on skin or tapping out prophecies in a code of knuckle-cracks and nail-scratches. Punishment takes the form of sighted exile, where offenders have their obsidian eyes removed and are forced to wander the world with restored vision, tormented by the "lies" they now perceive. The only unforgivable sin is willful ignorance—to reject a vision, no matter how horrific, is to spit in the face of truth itself. 
### Secret
The Seers' visions are not gifts - they're infections. Each prophecy is a fragment of a greater cosmic entity slowly colonizing their minds. The Ocular Key isn't a tool for enlightenment, but an egg. When the last Seer dies, what hatches will use their accumulated visions as a blueprint to rewrite reality.
### Hook I
It began in the city of Lareth, where a young minstrel awoke screaming about "the eyes in the walls," her own irises turned to frosted glass. Within days, the sickness spread—not through touch or breath, but through shared verse. Those who heard the infected's songs or read their writings began to dream of the same vast, lidless eye floating in an endless void. Upon waking, their vision would distort at the edges, reality bending like wet parchment, until finally their eyes clouded over entirely, leaving them blind—but newly aware.

The Glass-Eyed Seers call it The Awakening, but the afflicted know it as a curse. Their blindness does not bring darkness—it reveals the things between things: the crawling filaments that connect all living beings, the hollow spaces where time has worn thin, the whispering motes of light that cluster around lies. Some tear out their new glass eyes in terror. Others, seduced by the visions, seek out the Seers, desperate to understand.

Now the plague is spreading beyond Lareth. A child's nursery rhyme in a distant village births a new cluster of cases. A love letter carries the infection to a noble court. The Seers watch, record, and wait—for they believe the plague is not an illness, but a revelation, the first step in humanity's evolution toward true sight. The party might be hired to:

Investigate the Source: The plague's origin traces to a meteorite fragment in the Lareth Archives, now stolen by a rogue Seer who believes he can "perfect" the infection.

Contain the Spread: Burning infected texts only releases the visions as smoke—new victims inhale the madness. A scholar claims the only cure lies in the Lens of Lethe, a Seer artifact that can erase memories.

Survive the Awakening: One party member becomes infected. Their dreams grow louder. Soon, they see through the eyes of every other infected person simultaneously. The Seers offer help—for a price.

### Hook II
The old woman arrived at dawn, her eye sockets sewn shut with silver thread, her robes stitched from the pages of forbidden texts. She carried a wrapped bundle that wept black oil and spoke in a voice that wasn't hers.

"I have seen your death," she told the party. "Not one, but all of them. The knife, the spell, the fall... every path leads to blood. Except one."

Her request is simple: escort her to the Shrine of Dripping Visions, where the walls bleed prophecy. She must perform a ritual to "unsee" a vision that could doom the cult—but the journey is suicide. The Seers have foreseen her death a thousand times, each more gruesome than the last. They believe this fate is fixed, immutable. She believes the party can change it.

Along the way:

The Forest of Frozen Screams: A blighted grove where trees bear faces, each eternally howling a different death premonition. The woman's future deaths play out among the branches.

The Bridge of Choices: A crumbling span where every step forces visions of alternate decisions. Some party members may see themselves betraying the others.

The Shrine's Price: The ritual requires a sacrifice—not of blood, but of memory. Each participant must surrender one pivotal life moment to the dripping walls.

### Encounter table
| Roll | Encounter | Description |
|:----:|:-----------:|---------|  
| 1 | **Obsidian Watchers (1d4)** |Blind monks with glass eyes that project nightmares |  
| 2 | **The Fractured** |A Seer mid-vision, their body splitting into possible futures |  
| 3 | **Living Prophecy** | A floating eye that recites doom (causes deja vu) |  
| 4 | **Mercury Ghoul** | A failed initiate who leaks liquid visions |  
| 5 | **The Unseen** | An invisible entity only the blinded can perceive |  
| 6 | **Sylas' Echo** | A time-lost fragment of the leader, mad with future-knowledge |

**Leadership**: Julien Renalt::

**Alignment**: Lawful Evil::

### Goal
The Hollow Choir seeks to compose "The Requiem of Living Silence"—a song so perfect it will rewrite the fundamental laws of existence. They believe that if performed flawlessly by an orchestra of the undead, this requiem will unravel death itself, transforming all living things into eternal notes in an undying symphony. Every stolen breath, every harvested voice, every soul bound to an instrument brings them closer to the day when the universe itself will hold its breath... and forget how to die.
### Ability


As a bonus action, a Hollow Choir member can hum a haunting melody. All creatures within 20 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution save or suffer one of the following effects by their  choice:

- "Hold the Note": The target’s muscles lock in place (restrained) until the end of their next turn as their tendons vibrate unnaturally.

- "Sing Along": The target involuntarily shouts or sings, ruining stealth and giving away their position.

- "Final Rest": The target’s heartbeat syncs to the dirge—if they take damage before their next turn, they take an extra 1d6 necrotic damage as their ribs shudder.

**"The music never stops—it just changes key."**
{text-align:center}
### Abstract
A symphony of death-obsessed virtuosos who play instruments carved from bones and sing with voices stolen from corpses. They worship the Silent Maestro, a lich-conductor who claims true resurrection lies not in magic, but in music so perfect it forces the universe to rewrite reality. Their grand heresy? To raise the dead through pure artistry alone—no spells, no divine intervention, just the flawless convergence of melody and mortal longing.

Their performances are lethal rituals: audiences leave lighter—missing breaths, heartbeats, or memories, all "donated" to fuel the Maestro’s magnum opus: The Requiem of Living Silence, a song that will—they swear—play the world backward to a time before death existed.

:
### Hierarchy
The Hollow Choir operates with the precision of a grand orchestra, each member bound to their role in the pursuit of their macabre masterpiece. At the top reigns the Silent Maestro, a skeletal conductor whose baton directs not just music, but the flow of life and death itself. Beneath them stand the Principals, virtuoso undead who lead each section of the choir—strings made of sinew, wind instruments carved from ribs, and percussion of hollowed skulls. These elite musicians are the cult’s enforcers, ensuring every note played serves the Maestro’s vision.

The Choristers form the rank and file, living and undead devotees who have surrendered their voices to the choir’s collective harmony. Their throats bear self-inflicted scars, a mark of their vow to sing only for the Maestro. Among them slink the Librettists, scribes who transcribe the screams of the dying into sheet music, and the Tuning Forks, assassins who "adjust" flawed performers with surgical precision. At the bottom languish the Audience, prisoners forced to bear witness to rehearsals, their life force slowly drained to sustain the choir’s unholy symphony.

:
### History
The Hollow Choir began with a single, dissonant note—the dying breath of **Maestro Orpheo Valmora**, a composer who sold his soul for the perfect requiem. When his beloved, the soprano **Seraphine di Cantave**, succumbed to poison at the climax of her final aria, Orpheo refused to let silence claim her. He conducted her corpse through the remainder of the performance, her lifeless voice rising in unnatural harmony with the choir. The audience, too enraptured to

flee, joined in—and by dawn, every throat in the opera house had been *"donated"* to the Maestro’s growing symphony.  

Their true power awoke when they discovered the **Cantus Ossium**, an ancient score etched on human bones. When played, it didn’t just raise the dead—it *composed* them, stitching souls into instruments that played themselves. Their first masterpiece, **The Bone Oratorio**, turned an entire cathedral congregation into a living orchestra, their screams harmonizing with the pipe organ’s dying notes. The Choir grew, recruiting musicians willing to trade their mortality for eternal performance, their bodies slowly transforming into instruments—violinists with fused fingerbones, flautists with hollowed ribcages, drummers whose hearts beat in perfect 4/4 time.  

A faction sought to use the Cantus not just to animate corpses, but to *rewrite death itself*—to compose a world where souls cycled endlessly through movements of agony and ecstasy. The ensuing conflict, the **War of Discord**, saw rival conductors weaponizing soundwaves—entire cities collapsed into glass from ultrasonic high notes, while basso profundo chants liquefied organs inside living bodies. The war ended when Orpheo (or something wearing his face) appeared on a shatered stage and *"corrected"* the score. The survivors awoke with their ears sewn shut, knowing only that they must **keep playing**.  
Their magnum opus—**The Requiem of Living Silence**—proved their ultimate thesis: *music could unmake reality*. A kingdom’s worth of souls dissolved into a single, sustained chord, their memories becoming sheet music. By the final cadence, only the Choir remained, their instruments now fattened with fresh suffering.  

Now, they infiltrate concert halls and battlefields alike, their **Principals** and **Librettists** harvesting voices for the grand finale. Their next movement? The **Eternal Crescendo**, where the world will learn the final truth: *"Death is just a rest note—and the Maestro decides when it ends."*  



### Timeline 
- **Founding Era:** Orpheo Valmora conducts his dead lover’s corpse in the **Aria of the Damned**.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Cantus Ossium** is unearthed, granting power over flesh and bone.  
- **Expansion Era:** The Choir turns audiences into instruments across the continent.  
- **Schism Era:** The **War of Discord** fractures the Choir over art versus annihilation.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The **Requiem of Living Silence** erases an entire kingdom’s death.  
- **Present Era:** The Choir prepares their **Eternal Crescendo**—a symphony to end time.

### Location and Base
A gargantuan, decaying theater suspended impossibly over a bottomless chasm, its foundations held together by the petrified screams of past audiences. The velvet seats are stuffed with hair and teeth, the chandeliers drip with frozen tears, and the stage curtains are stitched from the skin of failed musicians. At the center looms the Grand Resonator, an organ-like apparatus built from fused spinal columns, its pipes stretching up through the fractured dome where trapped souls swirl like storm clouds. The air hums with a deafening silence—the residual echo of performances that never truly end. Time behaves strangely here; visitors often glimpse phantom rehearsals from centuries past playing out in the rafters, or find themselves mouthing lyrics to songs that haven’t been written yet.
:
### Pecularity
The cult’s music literally alters reality within earshot—walls bleed harmonic resonance, the air thickens into visible soundwaves, and those who listen too closely find their own heartbeats syncing to the rhythm. The longer someone listens, the more their life force becomes entwined with the music, until they can no longer tell if they’re breathing or being played. Worst of all, the choir’s compositions are infectious—once heard, they echo endlessly in the mind, slowly replacing the listener’s memories with the Maestro’s opus.
:
### Public Perception
To outsiders, the Choir is a myth—a ghost story told by musicians who vanish after midnight rehearsals. Nobles whisper of a "cursed concerto" that drives listeners to carve sheet music into their own flesh, while peasants fear the Wandering Chord, a harmonic hum that precedes entire villages collapsing into glass statues. The Church condemns them as "the Singing Plague," but even holy choirs secretly study their techniques. When the wealthy hear rumors of a private performance, they pay in gold and orphans for a seat—never realizing they’ll be part of the percussion section.
:
### Membership
To join is to surrender one’s voice—literally. Aspiring members undergo the "First Movement": a ritual where their vocal cords are extracted and woven into the Choir’s collective tapestry. In return, they receive an "instrument-graft"—a fused musical prosthesis (a violinist’s arm becomes the bow; a flautist’s tongue molds into the mouthpiece). Promotion requires composing a new movement of the Requiem using "living materials"—a successful piece might transform a village’s population into human violins, their sinews vibrating in eternal harmony.

### Code of Conduct
"Perfection requires sacrifice—yours or theirs." The Choir operates under The Maestro’s Absolute Tempo, a rigid doctrine where musical precision governs all actions. Discord is punishable by "reeducation"—the offender’s tendons are restrung as instrument cords, their screams tuned to proper pitch. Members must attend nightly rehearsals, where mistakes are corrected via surgical alteration (flat notes warrant removed ribs; sharp tones earn tightened vocal cords). The highest law?

#### Cursed Artefact 
## The Cantus Ossium 

*Legendary, Requires Attunement (Cursed)*  
}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This orchestral score is etched onto sheets of stretched human parchment, its staves made from spinal columns and notes carved from teeth. The pages hum when touched, vibrating with the trapped screams of previous conductors. When "played" (by tracing the bone notations with a finger or bow), it composes reality itself—but always in a minor key.  



#### **Properties**  
- **Symphony of Flesh:** As an action, you can "play" a movement. All creatures within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution save or suffer one of the 3 followings:  
  - *Bone Allegro:* Their skeleton vibrates violently (3d10 necrotic damage, speed halved for 1 minute).  
  - *Largo of Liquefaction:* Their organs resonate (disadvantage on Concentration, vomit blood).
  
:
  - *Requiem Reflex:* They repeat their last action uncontrollably next turn.  
:
- **The Perfect Cadence:** Once per long rest, spend 1 hour conducting a full piece. Choose a corpse within sight—it rises as a **Symphonic Undead** (see stat block below), its body warped into a living instrument (e.g., ribcage harp, femur flute). It obeys only the Cantus’ holder.  

- **Final Movement:** When you would die, your body collapses into a pile of musical notes. You reform 1d4 days later in the last place you conducted, but 1d4 of your bones are permanently missing—replaced with ivory instrument fragments.

### Julien Renalt's Backstory
Long before he became a legend, Julien Renalt was a man of mortal brilliance. A composer without equal, his works could lull tyrants into weeping confessions and drive entire courts into ecstatic silence. His melodies were not merely heard—they were felt in the marrow, as though echoing some forgotten truth about existence itself.

But Julien’s passion was not art. It was perfection. Not fame, not praise, not even beauty—just the precise, aching clarity of a note played exactly as it must be. He became obsessed with a single, all-consuming work: a symphony he called The Requiem of Living Silence. He claimed it would be his final work, one so flawless it would halt death, silence time, and draw back the veil between soul and sound.

As the years passed and his fingers began to falter, Julien turned to increasingly esoteric means to complete his vision. He studied the harmonic patterns in whale-song, the resonance of cathedral bells struck during eclipses, the whispered cadences of the dying. And in his solitude, he began to hear a voice—not in his ears, but in the rests between notes. It spoke in harmonics, resonances, chords older than creation. An entity, vast and patient, had been listening to Julien’s music all along.

It called itself the Archivist of Silence, and it offered him a final duet: Conduct the great silencing, and I will grant you eternity to perfect your Requiem.

Julien agreed.

On the night of his final mortal performance, he died with a smile on his lips and a baton clenched in his hand. But his orchestra played on—guided by unseen forces, their eyes vacant, their bows and breaths no longer their own. The audience applauded, unaware they had witnessed something profane. Julien’s soul had not departed. It had been woven into the very score of his masterpiece.

When he rose again, he was no longer flesh. Julien Renalt had become a lich, but not one bound to a jewel or a vault. His phylactery was music itself—the Requiem, inscribed in shifting notation across endless sheets of silver parchment that sing when touched.

Thus was born the Silent Maestro.

### Seraphine di Cantave's Backstory
Once a prodigious soprano named Seraphine di Cantave, she was famed across courts and cathedrals for a voice so pure and piercing it was said to reach beyond mortal realms. Her singing was not mere entertainment but a rare communion—a bridge between life and death. So profound was her gift that, in a singular moment defying all known laws, she moved the Silent Maestro, a lich lord of unfathomable power, to tears. This feat was considered impossible, a myth whispered among necromancers and cultists alike. Moved by a dark, twisted admiration, the Maestro offered her a terrible gift: immortality, a chance to sing forever in his eternal choir. But Seraphine, holding fast to her humanity and freedom, refused.

In retaliation, the Silent Maestro enacted a cruel vengeance. With necrotic thread, he stitched her lips shut, silencing the voice that had once captivated kings and spirits alike. Worse, he bound her very soul to a shatered violin, an instrument cursed to channel not music but the agonised screams of the dead. Thus transformed, she became the Weeping Soloist—a ghostly figure draped in tattered concert silks, her face pale and unmoving, her mouth sealed forever in silent protest. Though she can no longer speak, her prophecies endure through the spectral music played by invisible hands on her cursed violin. Each haunting melody weaves visions of deaths yet to come: some inevitable, others orchestrated by the hidden hand of the choir’s dark symphony.

The cult that serves the Hollow Choir listens intently to these dissonant harmonies, interpreting them as divine instruction, a map of fate itself. Yet Seraphine’s true purpose is far more subversive. Her music twists the very air around its listeners, forcing them to relive their darkest memories in a rising crescendo—a cruel reminder that the Maestro’s grand symphony is built upon stolen voices and stolen suffering. Hidden within the shatered violin lies a single, unplayed note—the last remnant of Seraphine’s original voice. Should this note ever be freed, it could either shatter the Maestro’s terrible hold over the choir or unleash a scream so devastating it could silence every living thing within the concert hall. The Hollow Choir guards her obsessively, knowing she is both their most precious oracle and their gravest threat.

### Additional Notes For GMs
"The Choir’s power grows in places of suffering—describe how the environment ‘keeps time’ (dripping blood in rhythm, wind howling through bone pipes). If the party stays too long in their territory, have them make CON saves to avoid developing an earworm (disadvantage on Perception)."

### Secret
{padding-left:40px,margin-top:-10px}
The Choir’s true goal is not just to compose death—but to replace the gods of the afterlife with the Maestro’s symphony. Their Eternal Crescendo aims to trap every soul in an endless performance, where the dying become instruments, the living become the audience, and the Maestro conducts the universe itself. Hidden deep in the Cantus Ossium’s final page is the truth: the Maestro is not Orpheo Valmora, but the first victim of the original score—a sacrificed choirboy whose bones were used to carve the notes.
### Hook I
A child prophet named Lirin has been drawing eerily accurate sketches of future events—except every drawing is a musical score. His latest depicts the party’s own deaths, notated in blood-red ink with the marking: "To be played in D minor." The local church has declared him blessed, but the truth is far worse: Lirin is a failed Librettist, a boy the Hollow Choir tried to turn into a living instrument. His mind shatered under the strain, leaving him with fractured visions of the Cantus Ossium’s grand design.

The party is approached by a defected Chorister, their vocal cords crudely stitched shut. Through gestures and written notes, they reveal that Lirin’s drawings are literal. The Choir plans to use his prophecies as a "script" for their next performance—a massacre timed to the exact measures of his music. The boy’s final drawing shows a cathedral collapsing into a single, perfect chord, with the party’s faces among the notes. The Chorister begs for help: "They’re coming to collect him. When they play his song, the world will forget it ever happened."

The party must protect Lirin long enough to decipher his scores, but the boy’s mind is unraveling. He hums constantly, and those who listen too closely begin to hear their own deaths in the melody. The Choir’s enforcers—Symphonic Undead with instruments grafted to their bodies—are already hunting him. If the party fails, Lirin’s final prophecy will come true: a performance where the audience is the orchestra, and their screams are the last notes ever played.

### Hook II
The party arrives in the city of Verdain, where the nobility have become obsessed with a new art form: glass singing. Wealthy patrons pay exorbitant sums to attend private concerts where performers "play" wine glasses filled with liquid silver, producing unearthly harmonies. But the truth is far darker—the Hollow Choir has replaced the city’s musicians with Living Instruments, their throats surgically altered to resonate at frequencies that turn listeners' bones brittle. The latest performance left an entire audience frozen in place, their bodies transformed into human crystal statues, faces locked in ecstasy.

The party is hired by a desperate glassmaker whose daughter, a former singer, vanished after attending a concert. Her last words were "I can still hear the Maestro in my teeth." Investigation reveals that the Choir is using the concerts to "tune" the city for their Eternal  
Crescendo—each performance subtly rewrites the attendees' memories, making them more susceptible to  
the Cantus Ossium’s final movement. The glass statues aren’t victims; they’re resonance chambers, waiting to shatter the city in a single, catastrophic note.

To stop the Choir, the party must infiltrate the next concert—but the moment they enter the hall, the doors seal shut, and the Maestro raises his baton. The air itself vibrates with impending doom. Worse, the party’s own weapons begin to hum in harmony, threatening to turn against them. The only way out is to disrupt the symphony, but doing so risks shattering every glass statue in the room—including the glassmaker’s daughter.

### Encounter table
| Roll | Title                  | Description    |  
|:----:|------------------------|------------|  
| 1    | **The Unfinished Symphony** | 1d4+2 corpses stand frozen mid-performance, their hollowed ribcages stretched into harp strings. Touching one triggers a **death aria** (DC 15 CON save or take 3d6 necrotic damage as your bones vibrate). A shatered baton nearby bears the inscription *"Maestro was here."* |  
| 2    | **The Silent Soloist**  | A **Symphonic Undead** (violinist with fused spine) plays an endless loop of *"Seraphine’s Last Aria."* Those who listen for 1 round must make a DC 16 CHA save or be **charmed into joining the choir** (walks toward sound, arms raised like a conductor). |  
| 3    | **The Bone Conservatory** | A chapel-turned-rehearsal space where the pews are made of femurs and sheet music is tattooed on flayed skin. Attempting to read it forces a DC 17 INT save—fail and you **hum the Cantus Ossium** uncontrollably for 1 hour (reveals your location to the Choir). |  
| 4    | **The Perfect Pitch**   | A fountain of liquid mercury bubbles in a cathedral’s heart. Drinking it grants **advantage on Performance checks** but permanently lowers CON by 1 as your vocal cords turn to metal. Stirring it summons 1d6 **mercury-coated Choristers**. |  
| 5    | **The Maestro’s Draft** | A discarded page of the Cantus Ossium floats in the air, its notes squirming like worms. Playing it (even mentally) forces a DC 18 WIS save—fail and you **compose your own death** (next attack against you crits). Burning it deals 4d6 psychic damage to the arsonist. |  
| 6    | **Eternal Encore**      | The Hollow Choir’s **ghostly rehearsal** flickers in and out of time. Witnessing it ages viewers 1d10 years, but memorizing a measure lets them **predict enemy moves** (+2 AC vs one creature) for 1 day. Interrupting it triggers a **symphonic backlash** (8d8 thunder damage in a 30-ft cone). |

## The Hollow Crown

**Leadership**: Veylis the Architect::

**Alignment**: Lawful Evil::

}}
---
### Goal
The Hollow Crown exists to perpetuate the ultimate lie: that destiny chooses rulers. In truth, they manufacture "chosen ones" from orphaned children, forging prophecies and staging miracles to install them as monarchs. But these puppet rulers serve a darker purpose—their eventual public sacrifice, where the cult harvests the "royal divinity" cultivated by their subjects' belief. Each coronation is a long con, each reign a countdown to the knife. The cult’s endgame is not merely control but the creation of a perpetual cycle where no throne is ever truly vacant, only waiting for the next sacrificial king or queen to be groomed, crowned, and ultimately drained to feed the Hollow Crown’s immortality.
### Ability

As a bonus action, a cultist pricks their palm and speaks a 10-word command. One creature within 30 feet must obey or take 3d6 psychic damage (Wisdom DC 15 half).

### Abstract
Beneath the gilded halls of every great kingdom, the Hollow Crown weaves its strings. This cult does not seek to overthrow rulers—it creates them. For generations, they have orchestrated prophecies, staged divine signs, and carefully molded orphaned children into the image of "chosen monarchs," only to later reveal the cruel truth: these kings and queens are but puppets, their coronations merely the first step toward a grand sacrificial rite. The cult’s true goal is not mere political control, but the harvesting of royal divinity—the belief of the people made manifest in their rulers’ blood. Each "prophecy" is a lie, each "miracle" a trick, and every crowned head is destined for the altar. The Hollow Crown ensures that no throne is ever truly unoccupied—only waiting for the next lamb to be led to slaughter.

:
### Hierarchy
The Hollow Crown operates as a perverse inversion of a royal court, with each member playing a role in the grand theater of deception. At the top stands Veylis the Architect, the mastermind who designs each false prophecy and selects the candidates for kingship. Beneath her are the High Diviners, scholars and historians who fabricate lineages and forge ancient texts, ensuring every "chosen one" has a past convincing enough to withstand scrutiny. The Crimson Heralds act as the public face of the cult, staging miracles and orchestrating the "discovery" of each monarch, while the Penumbral Ministers infiltrate royal courts as advisors, subtly guiding their puppets toward the cult’s desired outcomes. At the lowest tier are the Silent Pages, orphans taken from the streets and trained as servants—unaware that they are being evaluated as future sacrificial kings and queens. The cult’s power structure is fluid, with members often rising or falling based on their ability to maintain the illusion, for the Hollow Crown tolerates no failures—only fresh candidates for the altar.

:
### History
The Hollow Crown began with a single, stolen coronation—the **usurpation of King Aldric the Pious** by his own court bard, **Lucien d’Morvain**. When the true heir died mysteriously on the eve of his crowning, Lucien stepped forward with a forged prophecy, declaring himself the "Lost Scion of the Bloodfire Dynasty." The nobles, desperate for stability, believed him. For seven years, he ruled as a beloved monarch—until the night of his grand masquerade, when the masks of every guest *fused to their faces*, and Lucien revealed the truth: he was no king, but

##### The Theater of False Dawns

the first **Architect of the Hollow Crown**, and the entire court had been his unwitting audition.  

Their true power crystallized when they discovered the **Black Tome of Oblivion**, a grimoire penned by a forgotten god of lies. Its pages didn’t just record history—they *rewrote* it, stitching false lineages into reality’s fabric. Their first masterpiece, **The Reign of a Hundred Faces**, saw a single orphan boy playacted as twelve different monarchs across rival kingdoms, each "death" staged to incite wars that fed the cult’s influence. The Crown grew, recruiting historians, actors, and disgraced nobles—all willing to trade their identities for roles in the grand deception. Their bodies became living palimpsests, skin inked with revised genealogies, their very bones reshaped to fit royal portraits.  

A faction sought to use the Tome not just to manipulate kings, but to **erase the concept of truth itself**—to forge a world where history was whatever the Crown declared. The ensuing conflict, the **War of shatered Mirrors**, saw rival Architects weaponizing perception—entire cities forgot their own names, while armies turned on reflections of themselves. The war ended when Lucien (or something wearing his face) burned the original Tome and *"recast"* the survivors. They awoke as nameless scribes, knowing only that they must **keep rewriting**.  

Their magnum opus—**The Coronation of the Nameless**—proved their ultimate thesis: *anyone could be king if the lie was grand enough*. An entire dynasty was replaced overnight, their memories overwritten by the Crown’s narrative. By the final act, only the Architects remained, their faces now blank slates waiting for the next role.  

Now, they lurk in royal archives and orphanages alike, their **Diviners** and **Heralds** sculpting pawns for the grand performance. Their next act? The **Eclipse Dynasty**, where the world will learn the final truth: *"A crown is just a story—and the Hollow Crown holds the pen."*  

### Timeline
- **Founding Era:** Lucien d’Morvain usurps a throne with the **Prophecy of the Bloodfire Scion**.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Black Tome of Oblivion** is unearthed, granting power over memory.  
- **Expansion Era:** The Crown plants puppet rulers across the continent.  
- **Schism Era:** The **War of shatered Mirrors** fractures the Crown over truth versus illusion.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The **Coronation of the Nameless** erases an entire bloodline.  
- **Present Era:** The Crown prepares their **Eclipse Dynasty**—a reign with no beginning or end.

### Location and Base
{padding-left:35px}
Beneath the capital’s bustling streets, through sewers that reek of rust and rotting parchment, lies the entrance to the Theater of False Dawns—a cavernous, gilded nightmare where the Hollow Crown stages its grandest deceptions. The theater was once a legitimate opera house, centuries ago, before the cult hollowed it out like a rotten fruit and repurposed its grandeur for their macabre performances. Now, its velvet curtains are moth-eaten and stiff with old bloodstains, its chandeliers replaced by cages containing the preserved corpses of past puppet rulers, each lit from within by slow-burning witchfire. The air hums with the echoes of fake applause, a sound conjured by acoustical enchantments that never fade.

The stage itself is a perfect replica of the royal throne room, constructed from memory and stolen blueprints. Every detail is exact—from the grooves in the marble floor where generations of monarchs paced, to the faint scratch on the armrest left by a nervous queen’s ring. But the similarities end beneath the surface. The throne is rigged with hidden blades that extend during sacrificial rites, and the "jewels" in the crown-shaped proscenium are actually petrified eyes harvested from previous victims. The cult uses this stage to rehearse every coronation, every royal speech, and most importantly, every execution. Beneath the floorboards, a network of pipes feeds the grooves in the stage with fresh blood during performances, ensuring the symbolism isn’t lost on the audience—a audience comprised entirely of mannequins dressed as historical figures, their faces painted with the likenesses of dead nobles.

### Pecularity
The cult’s most disturbing trait is their "Crimson Rehearsal" ritual. Before a puppet ruler’s sacrifice, the Hollow Crown forces them to relive their entire "destiny" in a single night—a grotesque play where cultists reenact the monarch’s life, from their "miraculous discovery" to their impending death. The ruler is made to watch, paralyzed by drugs, as their own corpse is portrayed on stage. The ritual serves a dual purpose: it primes the victim’s soul for harvest, and it serves as macabre entertainment for the cult’s inner circle, who bet on how the real sacrifice will deviate from the script.

### Public Perception
To the outside world, the Hollow Crown is a myth—a cautionary tale about the dangers of ambition. Kings dismiss them as "theater folk playing dress-up," while scholars debate whether their supposed feats are merely exaggerated conspiracies. This is exactly how the cult prefers it. Their greatest trick is the **Doctrine of the Absurd**: by making their true nature seem *laughably improbable*, they ensure no one looks too closely at the inconsistencies in royal lineages. The few who uncover the truth are inevitably silenced—not with knives, but with *roles*, offered the chance to "join the performance" as complicit players rather than dissenting voices.

##### The Thrice-Sung Prophet
{margin-left:-12px}
:::::::::
### Membership
The Hollow Crown recruits from three pools: **the Broken** (disgraced nobles seeking redemption through a new identity), **the Blank** (orphans with no past to contradict the cult’s fictions), and **the Bought** (historians and artists bribed with the chance to reshape the world). Initiates undergo the **Rite of the Unfinished Portrait**, where their faces are painted over with the features of a dead monarch—if the likeness "takes," they are groomed for rulership; if not, they become scribes or stagehands. The highest ranks, the **Architects**, are forbidden from ever wearing the same face twice, their true forms lost beneath layers of stolen visages.

The cover pulses faintly, as if breathing, and those who touch it report hearing whispers in a language that feels both familiar and alien. When read aloud, the Codex doesn’t just recite words—it **rewrites the past**, altering memories and events in ways both subtle and horrifying.  




#### **Properties**  
- **The Penance of Thorns:** As an action, you can recite a passage. Choose one creature within 30 feet—they must make a DC 17 Wisdom save or suffer one of the following:

  - *Memory’s Bramble:* Their mind becomes tangled in false recollections (disadvantage on Intelligence checks and saves for 1 hour).
\column

  - *Bloodroot Edict:* Their veins darken as thorny growths erupt beneath their skin    (2d6 piercing damage per round for 3 rounds).  
  - *Oath of Silence:* They forget how to speak a language of your choice for 24 hours.  
:
- **The Last Revision:** Once per week, you can spend 10 minutes rewriting a single event from the past 24 hours. The change must be plausible (e.g., “The guard was never there” or “The letter said something else”), but reality reshapes to accommodate it. Those affected remember both versions, causing increasing dissonance with each use.  

- **Final Clause:** If you die while attuned, your soul is bound to the Codex. You become a **Thorn Wraith**, a spectral entity forced to haunt the book’s current owner, whispering revisions only they can hear.

### Veylis the Architect's Backstory
Veylis was not born into the Hollow Crown—she was its first true masterpiece. As a sickly child coughing blood in the gutters of a plague-ridden slum, she had no name worth remembering and no future worth fearing. Until one night, when a masked figure emerged from the fog, took her hand, and whispered: “You were born of lost kings.”

They told her she was the Lost Princess of Astara, last heir to a vanished kingdom destroyed by divine fire. Her life became a stage. She was educated in ancient dialects, trained in courtly poise, surrounded by advisors who whispered of destiny and divine right. She learned to walk like a monarch, to bleed like a martyr, and to pray like the gods were watching. The Hollow Crown fed her story to the world—fabricated lineage scrolls, arranged omens, entire towns hired to kneel in awe at her passing. By the time of her coronation, even she believed the lies.

It was not until the Night of the Coronation Sacrifice, when robed celebrants pressed blades to her throat under a cathedral of candlelight, that she understood the truth. She was no heir. She was no chosen one. She was a vessel—a lamb raised not for rule, but for slaughter.

But Veylis did not scream. She laughed.

Something in her laugh made the High Diviner hesitate. Not out of mercy, but curiosity. In that moment, he saw what even the cult’s seers had missed: this girl was not just a puppet. She was a prodigy.

Instead of dying, she was given a new title: The Architect. And she accepted it not out of fear, but fury.

Under her direction, the Hollow Crown became more than a cult—it became a machine. She redefined prophecy as theatre, scripting destinies to be believed, devoured, and discarded. She pioneered the use of echo prophecies, grooming multiple “chosen ones” across rival nations, each believing they were the sole fulfilment of an ancient myth. If one faltered, another would rise seamlessly, keeping the illusion alive.

She invented the Crown’s Remorse, a cruel psychological flourish: each puppet king or queen would eventually uncover their falsity—but only after their ascension, their victories, their love. The deeper their belief, the richer their despair. Their final, willing sacrifice would feed the gods of the Hollow Crown with emotions aged like rare wine.

Now, Veylis rules from a sanctum no map dares mark—its walls lined with portraits of every monarch she has made and unmade, their frames etched with dates of coronation and expiration. She calls it her Gallery of Lies.

Her greatest work is near completion: a child-king “prophesied” to unite the fractured continent. The miracles surrounding him have been meticulously staged. His humble origins scripted to inspire. His enemies sculpted to fall. The people love him.

He believes.

But the throne they are crafting for him?
It has already been fitted with hidden blades.

Because to Veylis, hope is the sweetest wine. And betrayal is the final, perfect note.

### The Thrice-Sung Prophet's Backstory
Born as a slave in the fighting pits of Karthax, the one who would become the Thrice-Sung Prophet was first noticed for his uncanny ability to predict the outcome of battles—not through divine insight, but by reading the subtle tremors of fear in the combatants’ stances. The Hollow Crown purchased him, not for his foresight, but for his voice: a deep, resonant baritone that could make even the driest scripture sound like revelation. They carved out his tongue to prevent him from ever speaking unprompted, then replaced it with a living silver cord, a relic that forces him to sing prophecies on command.

His first prophecy was a fluke. When asked to declare a random beggar boy the "Sun-King Reborn," his silver tongue twisted the words into a verse that came true three days later—a solar eclipse that coincided exactly with the boy’s procession. The second prophecy was coerced, the third accidental, and by the fourth, the cult realized the horror of what they had created: the Thrice-Sung Prophet’s predictions always come true, but never in the way intended. The "Sun-King" burned alive in his armor. The "Queen of Dawn" blinded her own people staring into the sun.

Now, the Prophet is kept in a soundproofed chamber, his silver tongue sewn shut between performances. The cult uses him sparingly, for his voice cracks reality itself. When he sings, the air thrums with dissonant harmonies, and listeners report seeing double visions—the world as it is, and as it will be when the prophecy destroys it.

The Codex's changes start subtle - a misplaced item, a name no one recalls. But with each use, the cracks in reality grow. Let players notice inconsistencies.

}}
### Code of Conduct
The cult operates under the **Rule of the Unwritten Script**: no member may speak the full truth of their actions aloud, lest the illusion shatter. All communication regarding active schemes is veiled in metaphor ("harvesting roses" for assassinations, "mending tapestries" for rewriting history). Betrayal is not punished with death—it is corrected with *editing*. Disgraced members are subjected to the **Penance of the Blank Page**, a ritual where their memories are systematically erased until they become empty vessels, ready to be rewritten as new characters in the Crown’s play. The only unforgivable sin is *innovation*; all deceptions must follow the Tome’s established patterns, lest reality resist the lie.  
### Secret
The Hollow Crown believes the Codex is a gift from their patron, but in truth it is a prison for an ancient archfey's rival. The thorns are remnants of a duel between two fey lords, and the book's power comes from the trapped entity's screams. If the Codex is burned in a sacred grove under a full moon, the archfey is freed—and the Pact's magic unravels.

### Hook I
The mayor’s chambers reek of ink and madness. She shoves a doll into the party’s hands—its stitching torn open where the heart should be—then shows them the tiny shoes hidden beneath her floorboards, the handprint in the attic dust, the name Lissa carved into the old oak’s bark. No one else remembers her daughter. Not the guards, not the servants, not even the girl’s own father. The town physician suggests the stress of office has cracked the mayor’s mind, but the party finds proof in the gaps: a blank space in the family portrait, a journal entry that ends midsentence, a seamstress who swears she never stitched the doll yet recognizes her own stitchwork.

The trail leads to the Blackthorn Pact’s hidden scriptorium, where the party arrives just in time to see the High Archivist close the Thorned Codex—and the mayor’s daughter, Lissa, blink as if waking from a dream. The girl doesn’t recognize her own mother. The Archivist strokes her hair and murmurs "Subject retains residual attachment. Recommend additional revisions" before the thorns swallow Lissa’s face again. Now the party must choose: destroy the Codex and risk erasing Lissa completely, or let the Pact continue rewriting history until even a mother’s love isn’t enough to remember.

### Hook II
The scholar’s hands leave bloody fingerprints on the blank parchment as he begs the party to understand. He saw the words moments ago—the peace treaty that ended the War of the Violet Dawn, the clause that spared thousands—but now the vellum is pristine. The library’s other records are changing too: paintings of the treaty signing now show drawn swords instead of handshakes, and the scholar’s own notes rewrite themselves as he watches, the ink crawling like ants across the page.

Breaking into the Pact’s stronghold reveals the scale of their operation. The walls breathe like living parchment, pulsing with half-formed memories. Crimson-robed scribes scurry between desks, dipping quills into their own wrists to ink fresh lies. At the center, the High Archivist prepares to sign the final clause that will reignite the war—but as the party intervenes, reality itself stutters. One moment their ally is beside them, the next they’re an enemy with a blade at their throat. The walls bleed ink where the party’s weapons pass through them. The only constant is the Archivist’s smile as he offers them the ultimate temptation: "Would you like to edit your own past?"

### Encounter table

### Goal
The ultimate aim of the Hollow Veil is nothing less than the dissolution of the Material Plane itself—a slow, deliberate unraveling of reality through the severing of its fundamental tethers: sight, language, and physical form. These three anchors, the cult teaches, are the mechanisms by which the illusion of reality is maintained, each one reinforcing the lie of solidity and separation. By abolishing sight, they deny the world’s false shape; by abandoning language, they escape the cage of structured thought; and by destroying the body, they reject the prison of flesh. Through ritual mutilation, mind-warping incantations, and communion with the Far Realm’s alien intelligences, the Hollow Veil seeks to erode the boundaries that define existence. Each act of unmaking weakens the veil a little more, allowing the Void’s influence to seep through. Their doctrine holds that when enough tethers are cut—within themselves, their surroundings, and ultimately across the world—the illusion of reality will collapse, and all that remains will be the pure, perfect nothingness of the Far Realm, unshackled by form or meaning.

### Ability

**Nihil’s Clarity**: This ability allows nihilist cultists to see through the illusions of meaning, exposing the emptiness of ambition, faith, and tradition. They have advantage on any check made to manipulate others into despair, discredit sacred beliefs, or reveal the futility of a cause.  
:
### Abstract
The Hollow Veil is a nihilistic sect of philosophers, mystics, and self-mutilating zealots who believe the Material Plane is an elaborate illusion—a "veil" cast by cruel or indifferent gods to blind mortals from the transcendent truth of the Void. Their dogma teaches that flesh, sight, and even language are chains binding the soul to falsehood. Through gruesome rituals, arcane study, and communion with Far Realm entities, they seek to "unweave" reality itself, peeling back the layers of deception until nothing remains but the pure, unfiltered Void.

Their practices are a grotesque fusion of asceticism and self-destruction: eyes are plucked out to "see beyond sight," tongues removed to "speak beyond words," and skin flayed to "shed the lie of the body." The cult is both feared and pitied, for its members are often brilliant minds broken by their revelations—philosophers who stared too long into the abyss and now worship the teeth they found there.

:
### Hierarchy
The Hollow Veil operates under a fractured yet rigid hierarchy known as the Spiral of Unmaking, where advancement is marked not by power or favour, but by acts of increasing self-negation. At its apex are the Veilwithered, enigmatic figures who have wholly renounced physical identity—blind, mute, and mutilated beyond recognition, they are revered as living conduits of the Void’s will. Beneath them are the Unbound Seers, those who have surrendered their senses to achieve higher perception, guiding initiates through revelation and madness. The Fleshscribes form the cult’s scholarly core, transcribing esoteric truths in blood and scarification, while Tongueless Shepherds oversee indoctrination through silent ritual and telepathic communion. At the lowest tier are the Petals of the Lie—new initiates who remain largely intact but are expected to prove their devotion through study, sacrifice, and self-inflicted suffering. Each rank spirals inward, drawing its adherents ever closer to the annihilation they call enlightenment.

### History
The Hollow Veil traces its origins to the doomed city of **Vorthas**, a once-great center of learning whose scholars delved too greedily into the nature of reality. Among them was **Philosopher-Celebrant Ithros**, who, while studying the *Tome of Unseen Truths*, became convinced that the world was an illusion—a grand deception woven by unseen jailers to blind mortals from the purity of the Void. His teachings attracted a small circle of disillusioned scholars, who met in the catacombs beneath Vorthas, performing rituals to "thin the Veil."  

Their work was deemed heretical, and when the city’s high priests uncovered their blasphemies, Ithros and his followers were sentenced to execution. But on the eve of their burning, the ground split open beneath Vorthas, swallowing the city whole. Only the cultists survived, dragged into the depths by something that whispered promises of revelation. They emerged days later, their eyes hollowed out, speaking of a **"great Unseeing"** that had shown them the truth.  

For centuries, the Hollow Veil lingered in the ruins of dead civilizations, gathering the lost and the broken—philosophers driven mad by their own questions, artists who saw too much, and mystics who could no longer bear the weight of false reality. Their numbers grew in secret, always one step ahead of those who sought to stamp them out.  

Their turning point came when the blind prophet **Malrik the Unwoven** unearthed the *Mirror of Unmaking* in the corpse-city of Il’Morthis. Gazing into it, he saw the Material Plane for what it truly was—a fragile illusion, fraying at the edges. Under his leadership, the cult abandoned shadows and began its **great work**: the systematic unraveling of reality itself. They inverted the Cathedral of Unseeing, turning it into a beacon for those who wished to "awaken," and their rituals grew bolder, their reach longer.  

Today, the Hollow Veil stands as a **cancer upon the world**, its influence spreading through forgotten places and desperate minds. Wherever truth is too heavy to bear, they offer the mercy of oblivion.  


### Timeline  
- **The First Revelation (3rd Era, 412)**: Ithros reads the *Tome of Unseen Truths* and founds the original sect beneath Vorthas. The city is swallowed by the earth.  
- **The Scattered Years (3rd–4th Era)**: The cult survives as a whispered rumor, haunting ruins and madhouses.  
- **The Unwoven Ascension (4th Era, 721)**: Malrik discovers the *Mirror of Unmaking* and becomes the Voice of the Void.  
- **The Inversion (4th Era, 802)**: The Cathedral of Unseeing is "corrected"—its floors become ceilings, its spires plunge into the earth.  
- **The Present (5th Era)**: The Hollow Veil’s cells operate across the world, each working to peel back the layers of the false reality.

### Location and Base
The Hollow Veil operates from the Cathedral of Unseeing, a once-sacred temple now suspended upside-down within a blighted valley where gravity warps unpredictably. Its shatered stained-glass windows weep black oil, and the pews float in eerie silence, defying natural law. Hidden beneath the cathedral lies the Chamber of Whispers, where the cult’s stolen Oracle children are kept in lightless cells, their mutterings echoing through the halls. The land around the cathedral is cursed—reflections move on their own, and those who linger too long begin to forget their own faces. Authorities avoid the region, believing it a gateway to something far worse than death.
:
### Pecularity
A defining and most feared feature of the Hollow Veil's sanctum is the Whispering Void—a ritual chamber carved into the bedrock of unreality, where the fabric of the Material Plane is said to wear thin. The walls are etched with spirals and sigils in languages not meant for mortal tongues, pulsing faintly as if alive. The very air in the chamber hums with fractured sound—disembodied murmurs, hissing syllables, and the indistinct echoes of voices long since unmade. Cult doctrine claims these are the final utterances of souls who have fully unraveled, their essence absorbed by the Void and now endlessly repeating its truths. Within this dim, silent-lit chamber, initiates are led to sit or kneel beside faultlines in the stone—fissures through which the Void is thought to "speak." There, in utter darkness, they press their ears to the cracks and listen. What they hear cannot be written or remembered in ordinary terms; it is not sound but understanding, raw and wordless, peeling away the illusions of being. Some crawl back from the edge with new insight, their faith deepened, their perception changed forever. Others do not return whole. A few are found staring blankly, muttering fragments of alien concepts until their minds collapse inwards; some vanish entirely, leaving behind only a faint scorched mark where their body once knelt. To the cult, this is no failure—it is ascension
:
### Public Perception
To the outside world, the Hollow Veil is a whispered nightmare—a cautionary tale of madness made manifest. Most commoners regard them with superstitious dread, blaming them for unexplained disappearances, crops that wither overnight, or reflections that move on their own. Parents frighten disobedient children with stories of the "Blind Ones" who steal the faces of those who stare too long into mirrors. Scholars and clergy denounce them as heretics who court annihilation, while city guards burn their sigils wherever they are found. Yet, a dark fascination lingers among the desperate and disillusioned—the broken, the terminally ill, and those who have glimpsed the abyss themselves. These lost souls sometimes seek out the cult, drawn by rumors of "truth" beyond the illusion of life.

##### Lissandra the Whispering
{margin-left:-12px}
:::::::::
Authorities ruthlessly suppress such whispers, for the Hollow Veil’s greatest threat is not their rituals, but the seductive simplicity of their nihilism—the idea that all suffering, all struggle, might simply be unmade.
### Membership
The Hollow Veil draws its ranks from society’s shatered and disillusioned—philosophers driven mad by unanswerable truths, grieving souls seeking escape from pain, and outcasts who see the world’s cruelty as proof of its falseness. Initiates endure the First Cut, a ritual where they carve the cult’s sigil into their flesh; those who flinch are deemed unworthy and left to bleed out. The most devout become Flensed Ones, peeling away skin to "shed the lies of the body," while others serve as Whisperers, spreading the cult’s doctrines through poisoned riddles. The inner circle, the Unseen, are hollow-eyed fanatics who have removed their senses one by one, believing blindness, deafness, and muteness to be pathways to enlightenment. Children stolen for their "pure sight" are groomed as Oracles, their voices silenced to better channel the Void’s murmurs. Few join willingly—most are broken first, then remade in the cult’s grotesque image.
:
### Code of Conduct
The Hollow Veil operates under a ruthless doctrine of "Unbinding the Self." Members must reject all illusions—lying is forbidden, pain is embraced as revelation, and the body is treated as a prison to be mutilated or discarded. Blind obedience is demanded from those who still possess senses, while the eyeless Unseen dictate the cult’s will without question. The highest law is the pursuit of the Void’s "truth," no matter the cost—even if it means sacrificing fellow cultists or unraveling one’s own mind. Weakness is purged; hesitation is betrayal. To question the path is to prove oneself still trapped in the lie of existence.
### Secret
The cult’s nihilistic dogma is a lie. The Void they worship is not an absence—it is a hungry entity, a starved elder thing from beyond reality that wants the Material Plane unmade so it can feast on the dying echoes of existence. The "truth" they preach is merely the entity’s whispered lure, a deception to turn its victims into willing butchers of their own world.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## Shadowrend, the Eclipse Blade

*Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  

}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
Forged from star-metal that drinks in light, this blade appears as a sliver of absolute darkness—until activated, when it erupts with swirling violet flames that cast no warmth. The crossguard is shaped like a crescent moon cradling a void, and the grip is wrapped in leather from a creature that never knew sunlight. When swung, it leaves behind ephemeral afterimages of extinguished constellations.  
#### **Properties** 
- **Voidflame Ignition:** As a bonus action, the wielder ignites or extinguishes the blade’s eerie flames. While active, attacks deal an additional 2d8 necrotic damage, and critical hits reduce the target’s max HP by the necrotic damage dealt until the next long rest.  
- **Umbral Sunder:** Against creatures native to the Shadowfell or those with Sunlight Sensitivity, the blade ignores resistance and treats immunity as resistance.  
- **Rift Cleave:** Once per dawn, the wielder can spend a spell slot to tear through dimensional barriers. For 1 minute, the blade can hit ethereal creatures and deals force damage instead of slashing.  
- **Twilight Beacon:** While flaming, the blade emits dim light in a 15-foot radius. Within this area, invisible creatures have disadvantage on Stealth checks, and the wielder can see through magical darkness as if it were dim light.

### Malrik the Unwoven's Backstory
Malrik Thorne was once hailed as one of the most gifted minds of his generation, a prodigy in the abstruse discipline of metaphysics at the Argent Athenaeum—a grand institution devoted to the arcane sciences and philosophical truth. Born into a minor noble house with a tradition of producing mages and theologians, Malrik’s intellect outshone his peers from a young age. He was particularly obsessed with the idea that perception shaped, and perhaps even created, reality. His lectures on the metaphysical boundaries between observer and observed drew crowds from across the academic world. Yet his curiosity soon exceeded the bounds of orthodoxy. Beneath the marble domes of the Athenaeum, he uncovered references to a proscribed tome known only in whispers—The Unbinding of Veils. The book had been purged from official libraries for its maddening implications, but Malrik’s mind, sharpened by pride and ambition, could not resist the pull.

Smuggled from a ruinous archive deep beneath the Stormvaults, The Unbinding of Veils challenged every foundational assumption of magical theory. It posited that the Material Plane was not merely shaped by consciousness but was in fact an elaborate fiction—an imposed illusion maintained by divine or alien entities to keep mortals docile and ignorant. Reality, the text insisted, was a lie co-authored by the senses. Malrik, captivated and horrified, began conducting unauthorised experiments: prolonged sensory deprivation, incantations borrowed from Far Realm syntax, and rituals aimed at severing the mind’s reliance on physical input. His final experiment—a complex invocation designed to pierce the boundaries of mortal perception—resulted in a catastrophic seizure and the permanent loss of his sight. But Malrik did not despair. Instead, he proclaimed his blindness a revelation, the lifting of a veil. What he had glimpsed, he would later say, was the Void—the formless, merciless truth beyond all being.

Declared unstable and excommunicated from the Athenaeum, Malrik vanished into obscurity, only to re-emerge years later as the founder of the Hollow Veil. He began attracting followers—disillusioned scholars, mystics plagued by visions, and broken mages desperate for meaning. To them, Malrik was no longer a failed academic, but a prophet who had torn the curtain from the world’s deceit. He preached that the senses were shackles, that language was a lie, and that only by unravelling the self could one glimpse the Void’s purity. His sermons were delivered not in words, but in drawn sigils, gestures, and telepathic impressions. Each new convert was urged to relinquish a piece of themselves—sight, voice, flesh—in a gradual descent toward the unfiltered truth.

Though many dismiss him as mad, Malrik remains a figure of terrible reverence within the Hollow Veil. Cloaked in tattered robes, his eye sockets burned to soot-black pits, he is both high priest and living symbol of the cult’s doctrine. He is said to commune with entities that speak in shapes and screams, and his presence in rituals causes the air itself to shiver. Despite his mutilation, or perhaps because of it, his mind burns brighter than ever—calculating, visionary, and wholly untethered from mortal morality. Malrik does not seek power in any conventional sense; he seeks liberation from the illusion of self, from the tyranny of creation itself. To his followers, he is a herald of dissolution. To his enemies, he is the embodiment of the abyss that waits beneath all things.

### Lissandra the Whispering's Backstory
Lissandra’s earliest memories are of cold stone floors and whispered prayers to indifferent gods—raised in a crumbling orphanage on the outskirts of Darrensgate, where the silence of the unwanted was mistaken for piety. She never cried, never spoke, and the caretakers assumed she was born mute. In truth, Lissandra simply listened. Even as a child, she could hear things others could not: the subtle thrumming beneath the world, the soft scrape of something vast and unseen shifting beyond the veil of reality. Her silence unnerved the other children, and many came to believe she was cursed. When she was twelve, a wandering member of the Hollow Veil passed through the town in search of "unopened vessels." The cultist saw in Lissandra not affliction but potential—an empty chalice ready to be filled.

She was spirited away in the dead of night and taken deep into the Bleakreach, where the Hollow Veil had carved sanctuaries into the bones of the earth. There, in a ritual known only as the Chalice of Listening, a measure of translucent ichor—drawn from a source the cult refuses to name—was poured into her ears while she lay blindfolded and restrained. Lissandra screamed for the first and last time as her hearing was scoured clean of the material world. When the pain subsided, she emerged reborn, her eyes glazed with a distant, unfocused light. She no longer heard voices in the ordinary sense; instead, the Void itself whispered to her in pulses of meaning, in shapes of thought no mortal language could express. Her first prophecy—a warning of a collapsing sigil-seal—saved dozens of cultists. From then on, she was kept cloistered and fed only when necessary, treated both as a saint and a sacrifice.

Each prophecy she delivers is received in reverent silence and transcribed in flesh by the Fleshscribes. Her visions are never wrong, but they are not gifts—they are taxes. Every utterance she channels through cracked lips robs her of time. Her body withers with each revelation, aging far beyond her years. Though she appears in her mid-thirties, she is barely twenty. Still, she continues, even begs for more. For Lissandra, the pain is proof. The Void does not lie, and the cost is a holy burden. She has no tongue for pleas or protest, only the ceaseless murmur of truths too heavy for sanity.

Now called The Ear of the Hollow, Lissandra is kept in a sanctified chamber lined with runes designed to dull the agony of her revelations. She is rarely seen, except during the Dark Concords, when the cult gathers to hear the Void’s will. Her presence is haunting: skeletal frame swathed in pale robes, skin etched with spiralling scars that seem to move when unobserved. Though her life bleeds away with each prophecy, she shows no fear—only devotion. To her, death is not an ending but a homecoming. She believes that when her final vision is spoken, she will dissolve into the Void entirely, becoming one with the truth that has gnawed at her mind since birth.

### Additional Notes For GMs
**GA secretive faction of disciplined zealots, the Order walks the razor’s edge between protector and tyrant. Their vast knowledge of dark cults makes them invaluable allies—if the party can stomach their morally gray methods. Play up their cold efficiency and internal tension over using forbidden power. They’ll help players stop apocalyptic threats, but always at a hidden cost.

### Hook I
The remote village of Bleakshelf is disappearing—one person at a time. Each morning, another home stands empty, its door left ajar, the beds cold. The only clues are streaks of black oil dripping from the villagers' vacant eye sockets and the faint, ghostly whispers of "the Veil" that linger in the air. The local priest claims it is divine punishment, while the few remaining villagers huddle in fear, speaking of shadowy figures who move through the streets at night. When the adventurers arrive, they find a community on the brink of collapse. The disappearances are accelerating, and those who remain are beginning to change—their reflections in still water no longer match their movements, their voices occasionally speaking in unison with something unseen. Deep beneath the village, in a network of forgotten catacombs, the Hollow Veil cult conducts their grim work. Their leader, a gaunt figure with hollowed eyes, conducts a ritual to "unsee" the entire village, erasing it from existence as they have done to so many before. The adventurers must navigate the collapsing minds of the remaining villagers, avoid the cult's traps, and confront the cult before Bleakshelf is wiped from memory entirely—along with everyone still inside it.

### Hook II
A noble family's youngest heir has vanished from their estate, only to return days later with hollow eyes and cryptic whispers about "the Unseen." The child moves with unsettling grace, speaking in riddles about the "lies of the flesh" and the "truth in the Void." The family, desperate and terrified, begs the adventurers to rescue their beloved child from the clutches of the Hollow Veil cult. But when the party tracks the child to the cult's lair—a gravity-defying, inverted cathedral where the air hums with dissonant whispers—they discover the horrifying truth: the child was not taken against their will. They chose this. The heir stands at the center of a ritual circle, their body a conduit for something far older and darker, their original soul trapped within the cult's cursed Mirror of Unmaking. The cultists, their skin carved with glowing sigils, chant in unison as reality itself begins to fray at the edges of the chamber. The party must decide: do they shatter the mirror, severing the child's soul to stop the ritual, or do they risk letting the cult complete their work—potentially unraveling the fabric of the town, or worse?

{{OrgName
## The Hollowborn
}}
:::
{{monster,orgstat
{{columns:2,statpart1



**Leadership**: Mother Hollowvein::

**Alignment**: Neutral Evil::

}}
---
### Goal
The Hollowborn exist to feed and ultimately rebirth their undead demigod, the Hollow Matron, through a gruesome cycle of infant sacrifice and replacement. They believe each stolen child's unlived potential contains pure cosmic energy that can reverse death itself. Their ultimate objective is the Grand Stillbirth - a ritual where they will sacrifice one child from every bloodline in the region simultaneously, using this concentrated life-force to make the Matron fully alive again. This reborn deity would then "bless" all future pregnancies, turning every newborn into a hollowed-out vessel for the Matron's will, creating a world where all children are born as perfect, obedient voids.
### Ability

As a bonus action, a cultist can make a changeling instantly mimic a recently deceased creature's appearance and memories for 1 hour (DC 16 Insight check to detect imperfections).

### Abstract
The Hollowborn do not worship death—they worship the moment before life begins, the sacred threshold where a soul is fresh, untainted, and infinitely malleable. They believe that by sacrificing newborns to their undead demigod, The Hollow Matron, they can harvest the pure essence of potential—the spark of what those children might have become. In their hidden catacombs, they perform the Rite of Unbirthing, draining infants of their futures and leaving behind hollow-eyed changelings crafted from grave soil and stolen breath. The Matron feeds on these stolen fates, growing stronger with each offering, her undead flesh slowly knitting itself into something alive again. To the outside world, the Hollowborn appear as midwives, healers, and grieving parents—kind faces hiding an unfathomable cruelty. Their true horror lies not in the killing, but in the replacement; every stolen child is swapped with a mimic, a soulless doll of clay and bone that grows alongside its "family," waiting for the night the Matron calls her children home.

:
### Hierarchy
The Hollowborn operate as a twisted mockery of a family, their structure mirroring the roles of a household corrupted. At the head sits Mother Hollowvein, the Matron’s chosen vessel, who issues commands in a voice woven from stolen children’s last breaths. Beneath her are the Hearth-Aunts, women who infiltrate communities as midwives and nursemaids, identifying potential offerings and crafting the changelings that will take their place. The Grief-Fathers serve as enforcers and grave robbers, their faces hidden behind masks of polished infant skulls, their hands skilled in both quiet murder and the art of crafting convincing replacements from grave dirt and blood. The lowest tier, the Cradle-Siblings, are the changelings themselves—soulless mimics left in place of stolen children, who slowly "grow" alongside their unwitting families until the Matron calls them home. Unlike other cults, there is no betrayal or infighting; all are united in their devotion to the Matron, their loyalty enforced by the terrible truth that each of them was likely a changeling once, their own memories of being replaced long since buried under layers of the Matron’s will.

:
### History
The Hollowborn began with a single, stolen breath—the first gasp of **Stillborn Eleanora**, whose lungs filled not with air, but with the whispers of the Hollow Matron. The child’s mother, **Midwife Vespera the Hollowed**, had carried

her corpse for three days, refusing to let go, until the Matron’s voice slithered into her ear: *"Give me one who never cried, and I will return a child who never dies."* That night, Vespera swapped a healthy infant for a doll of grave-clay and rot, offering the living babe to the Matron’s altar. By dawn, the changeling in the crib had drawn breath, its hollow eyes blinking with something almost like life.  

Their true power awoke when they discovered the **Cradle of Living Dust**, an artifact woven from the placentas of stillborn kings. When filled with stolen breath, the Cradle didn’t just mimic life—it *replaced* it, crafting perfect facsimiles that grew alongside their unwitting families. Their first masterpiece, **The Grand Replacement**, saw an entire village’s children swapped over a single moonless night. No one noticed. No one *ever* noticed. The Hollowborn grew, recruiting grieving mothers and childless fathers, their ranks swelling with those who would rather have a false child than none at all.  

A faction sought to use the Cradle not just to replace, but to *perfect*—to sculpt children who would never disobey, never disappoint, never die. The ensuing conflict, the **Culling of the Unworthy**, saw rival midwives poisoning pregnancies to harvest "purer" stock, while grave-nurses strangled infants deemed too flawed for the Matron’s design. The war ended when Vespera (or something wearing her skin) appeared in the nursery and *"blessed"* every living changeling at once. The survivors awoke with their wombs sewn shut, knowing only that they must **keep feeding the Matron**.  

Their magnum opus—**The Thousandfold Stillbirth**—proved their ultimate thesis: *innocence could be preserved forever, if never allowed to live*. A generation’s worth of stolen potential was distilled into a single, pulsing womb—the Hollow Matron’s new body, waiting to be born. By the ritual’s end, the cribs were empty, the mothers were silent, and the Matron’s laughter echoed through the hollows of the earth.  

Now, they walk among the living, their **Hearth-Aunts** and **Grief-Fathers** harvesting not just children, but the *idea* of children—the hopes, the names, the futures left unfulfilled. Their next ritual? The **Final Lullaby**, where every cradle in the world will rock in unison, and the Matron will open her eyes at last.  

### Timeline
- **Founding Era:** Vespera the Hollowed performs the first **Breath-Theft** upon Stillborn Eleanora.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Cradle of Living Dust** is unearthed from a royal crypt.  
- **Expansion Era:** The **Grand Replacement** swaps an entire village’s children unnoticed.  
- **Schism Era:** The **Culling of the Unworthy** divides the cult over purity versus hunger.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The **Thousandfold Stillbirth** merges a generation’s stolen potential.  
- **Present Era:** The Hollowborn prepare the **Final Lullaby**—the Matron’s rebirth.

### Location and Base
This cavernous underground nursery stretches beneath an abandoned orphanage, its walls lined with hundreds of tiny alcoves - each containing a preserved stillborn floating in nutrient-rich black fluid. The air smells of spoiled milk and damp earth, with a faint undercurrent of lavender that can't quite mask the decay. At the center stands the Crib of Living Clay, a massive structure woven from thousands of umbilical cords where new changelings are sculpted. The cords remain pulsingly alive, fed by a constant drip-system of stolen breastmilk and blood.

The deepest chamber houses the Nursery of Forgotten Names, where the Hollow Matron herself resides in a deathlike slumber. She floats in a vat of amniotic fluid that never dries, her emaciated form connected to hundreds of spectral umbilical cords that stretch upward through the ceiling - each one representing a changeling currently living above ground. The walls here are papered with children's drawings that shift subtly when unobserved, always depicting the same scene: a beautiful mother holding a child that isn't quite right.
:
### Pecularity
The cult's most disturbing trait is their Changelings' Growth. The doll-like replacements left behind don't simply mimic children - they biologically grow alongside their "siblings," developing false memories and personalities that perfectly mirror what the stolen child would have become. Over years, these constructs become indistinguishable from real humans, even to themselves, until the Matron's call awakens their true nature. The Hollowborn carefully monitor these changelings, sometimes for decades, waiting for the perfect moment to harvest them as adult sacrifices. This creates horrific situations where a person might discover their entire life was an illusion, their body crumbling to grave-dust as the Matron claims their accumulated life experiences.
:
### Public Perception
To the outside world, the Hollowborn are nothing more than a particularly devout order of midwives and orphanage keepers. Their reputation is spotless; they’re known for taking in unwanted pregnancies, comforting grieving parents, and finding homes for "difficult" children. This perception is their greatest weapon. When a child goes missing near their orphanages, people assume it was simply adopted. When a changeling acts strangely, they’re called "touched by grief" or "blessedly simple." The few who suspect the truth are quietly visited by a Grief-Father in the night—and by morning, they remember only that they were being foolish. After all, what kind of monster would steal a child?

##### The Cradle-Singe
{margin-left:-12px}
:::::::::
### Membership
The Hollowborn recruit from three pools: the Broken (parents who have lost children), the Empty (those who can never conceive), and the Willing (those who simply crave the power to shape life itself). Initiates undergo the Rite of the Unseen Midwife, where they must successfully swap an infant without the parents noticing, then care for the changeling as it "grows." The highest ranks, the Umbilical Choir, have had their reproductive organs surgically replaced with sacs of living grave-dust, allowing them to birth new changelings directly. Unlike other cults, there is no betrayal—only the Matron’s will, which flows through them like mother’s milk.

## The Hollowborn's Cursed Artifact  

*Legendary, Requires Attunement (Cursed)* 

}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This grotesque instrument is strung with preserved umbilical cords that hum with stolen first breaths. Its frame is carved from fused infant bones, each etched with the name of a child who never drew breath. When plucked, it doesn't produce music—it plays *the lives that might have been*, weaving alternate futures from stolen potential.  

\column

#### **Properties**  
- **Lullaby of Lost Tomorrows:** As an action, play a melody that forces creatures within 30 ft. to relive memories of lives they never lived (DC 18 Wis save or be incapacitated by visions for 1d4 rounds).  
- **Cradle's Echo:** Once per long rest, pluck a single cord to summon a **Hollow Changeling** grown from the listener's unrealized potential (lasts 1 hour before crumbling to dust).  
- **Final Breath:** When you would die, your last exhale sustains the Harp for 1d10 years. You become a Hollow Changeling serving the next wielder.

### Mother Hollowvein's Backstory
Born as Elspeth the Mercy-Bringer, she was once a midwife of humble origin, famed across the Mourning Coast for her gentle hands and unmatched compassion. Her touch was said to still even the most frantic labouring heart. But her descent into darkness began not with hatred, but with heartbreak—when her own child was born silent, cold, and still.
In the shivering hush of that night, as she wept alone in her cottage, a voice came to her, soft as a lullaby hummed through rotting teeth. The Matron, an ancient and forgotten entity of broken cradles and forsaken lullabies, whispered a cruel promise: her child’s soul could be returned—but only if she brought others in its place.

That same night, Elspeth made her first exchange. A noble’s infant, healthy and perfect, was taken and replaced with a clay effigy, veined with bloodroot and warmed by borrowed breath. When no one noticed—when even the child’s own mother smiled down at the impostor without question—Elspeth understood a terrible truth: no one truly sees their children. They see only what they wish to see.
Over the years, she refined her methods. She trained others—“Mothers of the Second Womb”—to perform the theft with precision. Wet nurses, birth midwives, undertakers, all became silent agents of the Matron’s will. They learned to mimic grief so well that even bereaved families felt strangely consoled, convinced that their child’s strange behaviour was just part of growing up. Those children, swapped in silence, became offerings, their stolen futures feeding the Matron’s hunger.
But hunger does not abate—it only evolves.

Soon, the Matron demanded more than mewling infants. She hungered for potential unformed: the unborn, the unshaped. Pregnant mothers were lured to sanctified groves and forgotten crypts with promises of painless births and divine blessings. Instead, their wombs were split open with reverence, and the flickering spark of future lives was harvested in ritual, their screams never heard.
Now known only as Mother Hollowvein, Elspeth is more vessel than woman. Her chest cavity has been hollowed out, ribs forming a cradle of bone, filled with squirming, preserved umbilical cords that writhe like serpents. The Matron’s fingers thread through her flesh like marionette strings, moving her as both prophet and puppet. When she speaks, it is not with her own voice, but with a choir of stolen children, their innocent tones reciting verses of blasphemy with perfect, gentle clarity.

### The Cradle-Singe's Backstory
No one remembers the Cradle-Singer’s original name, nor do they speak of her as if she was ever truly human. She was discovered deep within the Matron’s catacombs, a forgotten child swaddled in burial shrouds, her throat choked with grave dirt. When the Hollowborn cultists cleared her airway, she did not cry or speak—she sang. But the voice was not her own. It emerged hollow and mournful, resonating with the cold cadence of the Matron herself, the death-mother whose worship was older than language. Her lullabies quieted entire nurseries, lulled beasts into unnatural stillness, and her weeping could spoil food and curdle milk. To hear her whisper was to risk infertility, or worse.

The Hollowborn quickly understood she was not an oracle, nor a gifted singer—she was a vessel. The Matron’s will poured through her like wind through the ribs of a corpse. Her body changed to fit this grim purpose: her spine bent backward into a cruel arch, her arms grew long and crooked, and her jaw split at the corners to better release the Matron’s voice. She now dwells in the deepest chamber of the catacombs, cradling a basket woven from the bones of stillborn infants. When the cult seeks guidance, they do not ask her—they bring a living infant. Not to harm, but to offer as a conduit. The child’s cries are translated by the Cradle-Singer into divine prophecy, her voice shifting eerily between the Matron’s ancient rasp and the innocent gurgling of the newborn.

But this sacred service consumes her. Every prophecy she speaks strips away another layer of her fading humanity. Her skin peels like parchment left in the sun, revealing the clay and ash that seem to form her bones. She no longer sleeps, eats, or blinks. Her eyes are fixed eternally on the unseen, and the lullabies she sings now linger in the catacombs like spores, infecting dreams. The Hollowborn grow fearful, for they know the time is near when she will be fully unmade—when nothing remains but the Matron’s voice. And when that day comes, the Cradle-Singer will not sing to a child, but to the world itself, and lull all life into stillness.

Play up the uncanny valley of changelings—they're almost perfect, but blink too slowly or smile without crinkling their eyes.

### Code of Conduct
The Hollowborn operate under the Doctrine of the Unseen Womb, which dictates that all life is merely clay waiting to be sculpted by the Matron’s will. Their most sacred law is "Never let them notice"—every theft must be perfectly replaced, every grief perfectly mirrored. Members communicate through nursery rhymes with inverted meanings, their true intentions hidden in lullabies and swaddling cloth patterns. Punishment for failure is not death, but "reassignment"—the offending member becomes the next changeling, their memories rewritten to believe they were always the replacement. The only unforgivable sin is sentimentality; to mourn a stolen child as anything but an offering is to deny the Matron’s grace. 
### Secret
The Harp's cords must be periodically "retuned" with fresh stillborn amniotic fluid. If dried completely (exposed to sunlight for 24 hours), all active changelings within 10 miles crumble to dust and the Matron's connection weakens.

### Hook I
The noble family of House Vaelith has not slept in weeks. Their newborn daughter, Lady Liora, has not cried since birth—not when hungry, not when cold, not even when the family dog inexplicably died in her nursery. The crib rocks on its own each midnight, moving to a lullaby no one else hears. The wet nurse resigned after claiming the infant’s eyes "weren’t right"—too knowing, too old. Now the portraits along the grand hall show an extra child no one remembers posing for, a pale girl with Lady Liora’s face but decades older, standing just behind each family member like a shadow.

When the party investigates, they discover the truth: the real Liora was taken by the Hollowborn months ago, replaced with a changeling unlike any other. This one isn’t just mimicking—it’s evolving. It learns languages overnight, replicates mannerisms perfectly after seeing them once, and whispers secrets no infant could know. The Hollowborn want it back, for this changeling is no ordinary doll of grave-dust and stolen breath—it’s a vessel, growing strong enough to house the Hollow Matron’s full consciousness. But the changeling doesn’t want to return. It has grown attached to its "family," and the Matron does not tolerate disobedience in her children.

The party must navigate a web of decaying memories and unraveling reality. The changeling will manipulate them with visions of what it could become—a perfect daughter, a brilliant scholar, a beloved leader—if only they’d protect it. But with each passing hour, the noble family’s true memories fade, replaced by the changeling’s fabricated past. Soon, even the party might forget why they came, their minds reshaped by the Matron’s creeping influence. The crib never stops rocking. The portraits keep changing. And the thing in the nursery is learning how to lie.

### Hook II
Saint Marthael’s Home for Foundlings boasts a miraculous adoption rate—every child placed there finds a loving family within days. The matron, a kindly woman named Sister Heloise, claims it’s divine providence. The truth is far worse. The "orphans" are Hollowborn changelings, each planted to infiltrate the city’s most powerful households. The party is hired by a paranoid noble whose adopted son recited his full family lineage—including secrets buried for generations—before he could even walk.

Inside the orphanage, the air smells faintly of lavender and damp earth. The children are all eerily beautiful, with eyes that reflect too much light. At night, their cribs creak in unison, and the walls sweat black fluid that evaporates by dawn. The basement reveals Sister Heloise’s workshop: jars of preserved umbilical cords, vats of grave-dust mixed with breastmilk, and ledgers detailing which noble houses received which "gifts." The final horror waits in the attic—a hollowed-out wet nurse, her torso converted into a living cradle where new changelings are sculpted from stolen potential.

The party has until the next new moon to act—that’s when the Matron’s Grand Awakening is scheduled. Every changeling in the city will simultaneously "remember" their true purpose and begin harvesting their adoptive families’ life-forces. Sister Heloise offers the party a terrible bargain: help her secure one last batch of "donations" from the slums, and she’ll spare a few bloodlines of their choosing. But can they trust a woman who’s spent decades perfecting the art of the lie? And why do the orphanage walls keep whispering the party members’ childhood lullabies back to them?

{{OrgName
## The Iron Hymn
}}

{{columns:2,statpart1



**Leadership**: High Marshal Varek the Unbroken::

**Alignment**: Chaotic Evil::

### Goal
The Iron Hymn seeks to ignite an eternal world war that will never cease, a grand symphony of slaughter where battlefields become their temples and dying screams their hymns. They believe that by maximizing bloodshed across all nations, they will summon their war god from the void between realities - not as a mere deity to be worshipped, but as a physical conqueror who will lead the survivors into an age of unending carnage. Their agents work tirelessly to escalate every conflict, sabotaging peace talks, assassinating diplomats, and engineering atrocities that guarantee reciprocal vengeance. Their ultimate ambition is to collapse all civilization into a single, never-ending battle royale where the strong eternally prey upon the weak.
### Ability

As a bonus action, all bleeding creatures in 60 ft. take 2d6 necrotic damage and the Hymn's warriors heal half that amount.



}}

\column
::::::::::

### Abstract
The Iron Hymn does not worship war—they worship the moment of slaughter, the sacred instant when steel meets flesh and a life is offered to the god of endless battle. To them, peace is blasphemy, and mercy is heresy. Their creed is simple: "Let the world burn, so that the strong may rise from its ashes." They infiltrate kingdoms as mercenaries, generals, and arms dealers, whispering in the ears of rulers that war is glory, that their enemies plot against them, that hesitation is weakness. Their rituals are fought on battlefields, their hymns screamed by dying soldiers, their altars built from broken shields and shatered bones. They believe that if they can make war eternal—if they can stoke conflict until the entire world drowns in blood—their god will manifest, not as a destroyer, but as a conqueror who will lead the survivors into an age of unending strife.

:
### Hierarchy
The Iron Hymn is structured like a mercenary legion, but its ranks are forged in sacred violence. At the top stands High Marshal Varek, the Unbroken, whose word is law and whose strategies are treated as divine edicts. Beneath him are the Champions of the Hymn, elite warriors who have each ignited wars in their own right, their armor inscribed with the names of battles they’ve prolonged. The Herald-Soldiers act as both messengers and assassins, delivering declarations of war soaked in the blood of the last envoy, while the Forge-Priests maintain the cult’s arsenal, hammering weapons on anvils blessed with the screams of dying men. The lowest rank, the Chorus of the Damned, consists of fresh converts—prisoners of war, disillusioned soldiers, and broken souls who have yet to prove themselves worthy of the Hymn’s true purpose. These initiates are sent into battle without armor, armed only with a dagger and the promise that if they survive, they will be granted a place in the coming age of eternal war. The cult’s power is not in numbers, but in influence—they do not raise armies, they corrupt them, turning honorable soldiers into bloodthirsty zealots with whispers of glory and the scent of carnage in the air.

:
### History
The Iron Hymn began with a single, unbroken scream—the last breath of **Warlord Krazak the Undefeated**, who refused to die even as his body was split from collar to groin. As his blood soaked the battlefield, his rival knelt to claim his axe—only for Krazak’s corpse to seize the weapon and bury it in the victor’s skull. The fallen warlord

rose, his wounds stitched together by invisible threads of rage, and turned to the survivors with a grin of broken teeth. *"This isn’t over,"* he rasped. *"It will never be over."*  

Their true power awoke when they uncovered the **Anvil of the First War**, a massive slab of black iron that rang with the echoes of every battle ever fought. When weapons were forged upon it, they carried the memory of ancient bloodshed—and those slain by them rose again as hollow-eyed revenants, compelled to fight until their bodies were dust. Their first crusade, **The Hundred-Year Slaughter**, turned a border skirmish into an endless meat grinder, where the dead on both sides kept returning to the fray until the land itself drowned in gore. The Hymn grew, recruiting butchers and strategists alike, their bodies marked with ritual scars that pulsed like fresh wounds whenever violence neared.  

A faction sought to use the Anvil not just to resurrect warriors, but to **unmake peace itself**—to reforge the world into a crucible where conflict was as natural as breathing. The ensuing **Schism of Steel** saw brother turn against brother in battles where the fallen rose mid-fight to kill their former allies. The war ended when Krazak (or the thing wearing his skin) split the Anvil with his axe, sending shards of it embedding into every warrior present. The survivors awoke with iron in their veins, knowing only that they must **keep killing**.  

Their magnum opus—**The War Without End**—proved their ultimate truth: *battle was the only pure state of being*. An entire nation became trapped in a single, repeating battle, its soldiers dying and reviving in an endless loop of slaughter. When the dust settled, only the Hymn remained standing, their weapons forever sharp, their thirst forever unquenched.  

Now, they walk among kings and beggars alike, their **Heralds** and **Forge-Priests** stoking the embers of war in every heart. Their next campaign? **The Final Onslaught**, where the world will learn the last lesson: *"There is no victory—only the next fight."*  

### Timeline

- **Founding Era:** Krazak the Undefeated rises from death in the **Battle of Screaming Iron**.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Anvil of the First War** is unearthed, granting power over the slain.  
- **Expansion Era:** The Hymn turns minor conflicts into eternal battlegrounds.  
- **Schism Era:** The **Schism of Steel** fractures the cult over war’s purpose.  
- **Ascendance Era:** **The War Without End** traps a nation in perpetual battle.  
- **Present Era:** The Hymn prepares **The Final Onslaught**—a war to outlast time itself.

### Location and Base
The Iron Hymn's stronghold was once a grand cathedral dedicated to a god of peace, now desecrated into a monument to eternal war. Its vaulted ceilings hang with the shredded remains of surrender treaties and marriage contracts, each parchment dangling on chains made from melted-down peace medals. The stained glass windows have been replaced with panels of frozen blood depicting history's greatest massacres, illuminated from behind by ever-burning pyres of enemy banners.

Beneath the main hall lies the Pit of Echoing Steel, where the cult stores weapons taken from fallen warriors. Here, blades embedded in the walls whisper the final thoughts of their former owners, creating a perpetual murmur of dying regrets. At the center stands the Anvil of War, a massive block of iron forged from a thousand surrendered swords, where new weapons are hammered out to the rhythm of prisoners' screams. The air smells of iron, smoke, and something unnervingly sweet - the scent of the hallucinogenic war-paste smeared on initiates' weapons before battle.

### Pecularity
The cult's most disturbing trait is their Bloodsong Ritual, performed before every major battle. As warriors sharpen their blades, the Hymn's priests lead them in a haunting chant where every verse must be punctuated by self-inflicted wounds. The resulting chorus - a harmony of steel slicing flesh, pained gasps, and dripping blood - creates an eerie battle hymn that seems to echo across the battlefield regardless of distance. Those who survive these battles report hearing the same melody in their dreams, and deserters often find themselves unconsciously humming it during moments of violence. The song never truly leaves those who hear it, growing louder in their minds during each subsequent fight until they either embrace the Hymn's ways or go mad.

### Public Perception
To outsiders, the Iron Hymn are either revered as unstoppable mercenaries or feared as demonic warmongers—but never truly understood. Kings hire them for their brutality, only to find their wars spiraling beyond control. Survivors speak of battles where the Hymn’s warriors took wounds that should have killed them, only to keep fighting with grinning, bloodied teeth. The cult cares nothing for this reputation, for they know the truth: all who witness war eventually crave it. Their greatest weapon isn’t steel, but the creeping realization in their enemies’ hearts that maybe, just maybe, the Hymn is right.

### Membership
The Iron Hymn draws its ranks from three types: the Blooded (veterans who can’t function outside war), the Hollow (broken souls who only feel alive in battle), and the Forged (children raised on the Anvil’s steel, their bones laced with metal). Initiates undergo the Rite of

the Open Wound, where they must endure a mortal injury without crying out before being healed by the Forge-Priests’ searing irons. The highest ranks, the Eternal Legion, are warriors who have died and been resurrected so many times they no longer remember their original faces, their bodies more scar tissue than flesh.

### Code of Conduct
The cult operates under the Doctrine of the Unbroken Blade: surrender is the only sin, and mercy is punishable by flaying. Members communicate through "blood runes"—messages carved into flesh that heal into scars, ensuring every word is remembered in pain. Disputes are settled in the Pit of Echoing Steel, where combatants fight until one yields, though yielding means exile into the wilderness with a slow-acting poison and a dull knife. The only unpardonable crime is to die without taking an enemy with you—those who fail are resurrected as mindless revenants and thrown into the front lines of the next battle as penance.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## The Iron Hymn's Cursed Artifact

*Legendary, Requires Attunement (Cursed)* 
}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This massive iron greatsword was forged from the melted-down weapons of a hundred executed deserters. Its blade constantly weeps blood that evaporates into screaming faces, and its crossguard bears the embossed faces of history's most infamous warlords, their expressions shifting between agony and ecstasy. When driven into the ground, the Crucible pulses like a heartbeat, sending visible shockwaves of bloodlust through nearby warriors.  

---

#### **Properties**  
- **Battle Hymn:** While held, all allies within 30 ft. gain +2 to attack/damage rolls but suffer -2 to Wisdom saves. Each kill with this weapon extends the bonuses by 10 ft. for 1 hour.  
- **Scarlet Baptism:** On a critical hit, the victim's blood forms a spectral banner (10 ft. radius) that grants allies advantage on intimidation checks.  
- **Eternal Campaign:** The wielder no longer needs to eat, sleep, or breathe, but dreams only of battle and wakes exhausted unless they've spilled blood that day.  
- **Final Curse:** Upon the wielder's death, their skeleton animates as a **Blood Marshal** (CR 10) that seeks to continue their war.

### High Marshal Varek the Unbroken's Backstory
Varek was born on a battlefield, his mother slain before she could scream, his cries lost in the thunder of cavalry and cannon. A soldier found him nestled in the crook of a corpse’s arm, still slick with afterbirth, and sold him to a mercenary captain for a flask of rum and a dented helm. He learned to hold a sword before he could speak in full sentences, learned to read names only so he could carve them into the graves of those he had killed. By sixteen, he was a hardened killer; by twenty, he had led his first massacre. Yet every victory felt hollow. Each blood-soaked triumph left him emptier than the last, as though war itself teased him with meaning but never offered it.

That changed in the Whispering Wastes, where an abandoned shrine—half-buried in sand and bones—called to him. There, amidst crumbling effigies of a forgotten war-god, Varek heard something ancient stir. Not a voice, but a rhythm: the Iron Hymn. A song etched in the scream of tortured metal, in the percussion of falling shields, in the ragged breath of the dying. It did not speak to his ears—it resonated in his bones.

When he emerged days later, eyes dark with purpose, Varek had become more than a soldier. He was now the Choirmaster of Carnage, the prophet of a new theology where bloodshed was prayer and battlefields were altars. He gathered disciples—not believers, but veterans broken by peace. Disillusioned assassins, disgraced generals, and conscripts who had grown addicted to the sound of marrow breaking. Together, they gave form to the Iron Hymn—a cult, an army, a conspiracy of perpetual war.

They didn’t just wage wars; they composed them. Varek was a maestro of mayhem, crafting conflicts like symphonies: each ambush a crescendo, each siege a verse. His masterpiece was the Scarlet Schism, where a petty land dispute between two merchant baronies erupted into a continent-spanning genocide. He orchestrated it like a fugue—poisoning peace envoys, forging betrayal in ink and blood, even having his agents write contradictory histories before the war began. No one saw it coming. Everyone bled.

Now, Varek prepares his final composition: the War of the Last Dawn. A conflict to burn the very concept of peace to ash. For years, he has embedded sleepers in temples, spiked divine relics with heretical glyphs, and commissioned blades smithed with sacrificial screams in place of steel. He turns prophecy into bait and apocalypse into choreography. Nations are already shifting beneath his hand, though most don’t know they march to his rhythm.

His body is a map of old wars—scarred, broken, remade. Bones that cracked under siege engines. Skin scorched by arcane fire. His voice, when he speaks, does not echo. It rings, like the toll of a warhorn at dawn. And when he speaks, kings listen—not because they believe him, but because somewhere, deep in their blood, they hear the Hymn too. And they remember what it is to be afraid.

### The Dirgeborn's Backstory
No one knows the Dirgeborn’s original name. She was found as a child on the aftermath of the Battle of Weeping Spears, standing untouched in a field of corpses, her lips moving in silent prayer. When the Iron Hymn took her in, they realized she was no ordinary survivor—she was a living conduit for the god of slaughter’s will. Her voice, when she finally spoke, was not her own. It was the chorus of every soldier who had ever died in battle, their final words spilling from her mouth in a cacophony of pain and fury.

The Dirgeborn does not predict the future—she sings it into being. Her hymns, whispered in the dark before battles, become self-fulfilling prophecies. When she chants of fire, cities burn. When she murmurs of betrayal, allies turn on each other. Her body is covered in scarred verses, hymns carved into her flesh by Varek himself, each one a weapon waiting to be unleashed. The Hymn keeps her chained in a sanctum lined with the skulls of failed oracles, her lips stitched shut between performances. When the cult needs guidance, they cut the threads and let the war-god speak.

But the Dirgeborn is not just a tool—she is a living paradox. The more battles she inspires, the more her own mind fractures. She remembers every death she has ever sung, every life cut short by her words. Some nights, she claws at her own throat, trying to silence the voices. Others, she begs Varek to let her die. But the Iron Hymn will never release her. She is their most sacred weapon, and her final hymn, they believe, will be the song that births their god.

### Additional Notes For GMs
The Iron Hymn never fights fair - have them exploit surrender flags, poison healing wells, and always keep a "champion" in reserve to continue the war if defeated.

### Secret
The Iron Hymn's greatest vulnerability lies in their Blood Oaths - each member ritually swears fealty using their true name carved into the Crucible's blade. If the original Crucible is destroyed (requiring it to be sheathed in a living pacifist's heart), every oathsworn member suffers excruciating pain when wielding weapons until they atone for their sins.

### Hook I
The border war between Dalmere and Vostok has become a self-sustaining machine of slaughter. Villages on both sides have been razed so many times that the rubble has fused into jagged black monuments. Farmers till their fields with swords strapped to their plows. Children play "funeral" instead of house, burying dolls with the solemn precision of veteran gravediggers.

The Iron Hymn's handiwork is everywhere, but never visible. A Dalmish cavalry charge turns into a massacre because someone swapped their horses' feed with maddening herbs. A Vostoki peace envoy is found skinned alive, his flayed flesh arranged into their kingdom's banner. Each atrocity is carefully staged to ensure maximum retaliation. The cult's agents wear no uniforms—they are the grizzled sergeants who whisper "They're starving our prisoners", the camp followers who slip poison into healers' kits, the priests who declare surrender a sin against the gods of war.

At the heart of it all stands Marshal Kraye, the war's "hero"—a brilliant tactician who has "miraculously" survived seven suicidal charges. His true allegiance is revealed when the party catches him kneeling before the Bloodfont, a cursed spring where he washes his wounds to make them bleed anew each dawn. The final battle takes place during the False Truce of Greywatch, where both armies are ordered to lay down arms... only for hidden Hymn assassins to start shooting from both sides, ensuring the war continues forever.

### Hook II
It began with nightmares—veterans waking screaming about a "gray song" only they could hear. Then came the compulsive blade-sharpening, fingers worn to bone against whetstones. Now the afflicted gather in the Rust Hovels, derelict smithies where they hammer red-hot metal with bare hands, forging weapons that melt like wax before dawn.

The party's investigation leads to Captain Aldis, a decorated war hero who hangs himself with his own medals—only to wake the next day with no memory of dying. His chest bears the Mark of the Crucible, a brand that pulses when near the artifact's shard. The fragment is buried in the Memorial of the Thousand Swords, its corruption seeping into the city's water through rusted pipes. Those who drink it dream of a phantom battlefield where they must keep fighting or dissolve into the gray mist.

The Hymn's Choir of Steel moves openly now, their priests wearing cassocks made from chainmail. They preach that the plague is divine—that the infected are becoming "pure warriors," free from the weakness of peace. Their grand ritual approaches: at the next full moon, they will march the afflicted into the Foundry of Echoes to be reforged as living weapons. The only cure lies in the memories of General Voss, the retired commander who originally shatered the Crucible—but he's been taken to the Iron Abbey, where the Hymn is bleeding his memories out drop by drop.

## The Laughing Mask

{{columns:2,statpart1



**Leadership**: Lord Silvain D'Argent::

**Alignment**: Chaotic Evil::

### Goal
The Laughing Mask cult seeks to transcend mortality by becoming "perfect vampires" through the Crimson Jester's blessings, though their dark patron only mocks them with endless hunger - their true purpose is to serve as living wine cellars for its amusement, their refined palates forever chasing the vintage of true immortality just beyond reach.
### Ability

As a reaction when reduced to 0 HP, The Laughing Mask lets out a final, echoing laugh. Each creature that heard it must make a DC 15 Wisdom save. On a failure:

- They are overcome by manic laughter, incapacitated for 1d4 rounds.

- Their face muscles lock into a grotesque grin (disadvantage on Charisma checks) for 1 hour

- They forget the last 1 minute

- The Mask then reforms 1d4 days later in a random reflective surface, its laughter growing louder each time it "dies."

Mechanical Twist: The save DC increases by +1 for each previous  
time the Mask has used this ability in the campaign.

### Abstract
A decadent coven of blood-hunters who worship the Crimson Jester, an ancient vampiric entity that "blesses" its followers with a hunger for the finest vitae. They masquerade as elite sommeliers and pleasure-seekers, hosting exclusive tastings where the vintage is always human—aged to perfection in terrified, living casks. Their creed? "The noblest blood makes the sweetest sacrament."

:
### Hierarchy
The Crimson Jester (patron entity; a vampiric demigod of cruel indulgence)

Lord Silvain D'Argent (stat block below; the cult's vampire master)

Veinwardens (elite sommelier-assassins who "curate" blood vintages)

Hemoclasms (blood-drunk enforcers with partial transformations)

Unblooded (aspirants serving as prey or spies)

:
### History
The Laughing Mask began with a single, broken laugh—that of **Elio the Unmourned**, a court jester who saw the rot behind his kingdom’s gilded lies. After his beloved, a fellow performer, was executed for a noble’s amusement, Elio carved a grinning mask from the wood of her gallows and wore it as he burned the royal theater to the ground. The fire spread, consuming the district, and from the ashes emerged the first **Carnival of Knives**—a troupe of outcasts, rebels, and murderers who saw truth in Elio’s creed: *"All the world’s a stage, and all its players must bleed."*

Their true power awoke when they discovered the **Commedia Sanguina**, an ancient playbook written in human skin. Its scripts, when performed, warped reality—audiences forgot their names, assassins struck from shadows that weren’t there, and laughter turned to screams mid-breath. Their first grand performance, **The King’s Last Joke**, ended with the monarch clawing out his own eyes, convinced his court was made of puppets. The Carnival grew, its members hiding behind porcelain grins, their crimes dismissed as "madness."

A faction sought to use the Commedia not just to kill, but to remake society into a "grand farce" without rulers or rules. The ensuing conflict, the **War of Masks**, turned the Carnival against itself—actors stabbed each other mid-performance, stages collapsed into spike pits, and entire audiences were left catatonic from conflicting illusions. The war ended when Elio (or someone wearing his face) appeared on a burning stage and declared: *"Encore!"*

The survivors awoke with their memories of the conflict gone, knowing only that they must **keep performing**.    
Their masterpiece—**The Laughing Plague of Velmora**—proved their ultimate thesis: *laughter could be a weapon*. An entire city succumbed to hysterics, citizens giggling as they slit throats or danced off rooftops. By dawn, only the Carnival remained, bowing to corpses that still twitched with silent chuckles.    
Now, they move between noble balls and prison cells, their **Players** and **Puppeteers** wearing stolen faces. Their next act? The **Grand Comedy**, where the world will learn the punchline too late: *"No one survives the show."*  



### Timeline
- **Founding Era:** Elio the Unmourned crafts the first mask and burns the royal theater.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Commedia Sanguina** is unearthed, granting reality-warping performances.  
- **Expansion Era:** The Carnival poisons courts and streets with "living theater."  
- **Schism Era:** The **War of Masks** fractures the troupe over art versus anarchy.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The **Laughing Plague** proves mass hysteria can be orchestrated.  
- **Present Era:** The Masks prepare for their **Grand Comedy**—an apocalypse of applause.

### Location and Base
A vast, crumbling library suspended in a void of perpetual twilight, its black marble halls lined with shelves of empty books—each one a vessel for stolen memories. At the center looms the Chamber of Frozen Echoes, where the Hollowed One conducts rituals beneath a shatered oculus that leaks swirling smoke instead of light. Reflections in the polished obsidian floors show visitors not as they are, but as they will be after the cult erases them.
:
### Pecularity
Members obsessively rate blood like fine wine, keeping detailed ledgers of victims' "flavor profiles" (age, emotion, lineage), and host grotesque tasting parties where glasses are paired with the donors' terrified screams - the cult's elite even preserve particularly "vintaged" victims in wine barrels to age their blood to perfection.
:
### Public Perception
Most dismiss the cult as a macabre rumor, just another eccentric noble society with strange tasting rituals. Their lavish "wine auctions" are celebrated events, though attendees whisper about the unusually pale hosts and the strange, muffled noises from the cellars. Local missing persons cases often spike after their gatherings, but their political connections prevent investigation - until a victim escapes with stories of being "aged like wine" in blood-filled casks, their skin branded with vintage labels. The few who believe the truth dare not speak it, fearing they'll become the next "house specialty."
:
### Membership
The Laughing Mask selectively recruits from elite circles - disgraced nobles, master vintners, and jaded epicureans - through a twisted vetting process where candidates must present a "vintage" (a kidnapped victim whose blood meets exacting standards). Inner circle members bear the "Jester's Brand," a laughing mouth stitched with vampire fangs that pulses when near quality blood. New initiates endure the "First Tasting" - a ritual where they drink from a dying family member to prove their devotion to the cult over blood ties.
:
### Code of Conduct
"Never waste a drop" - all blood must be ceremonially consumed or preserved, fighting is forbidden at feedings (it "bruises the vintage"), and most sacred is their taboo against sunlight - not for fear of burning, but because it "ruins the bouquet" of their cursed wines.

### Secret
The Oracle's prophecies always come true, but never in the way listeners expect - they are truths distorted through the lens of the Absent One's hunger. To defeat it, adventurers must force the Oracle to confront its own reflection without the mask's protection. However, doing so risks unleashing Althera's trapped memories in a psychic explosion that could erase the minds of everyone nearby, leaving them as hollow as the Oracle itself. The true challenge isn't surviving the encounter, but deciding whether restoring Althera's memories is worth potentially destroying countless others in the process.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## The Commedia Sanguina

*Legendary, Requires Attunement (Cursed)*
}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This ancient playbook, bound in stitched human skin and inked in blood, contains scripts that rewrite reality when performed. Its pages flutter unnaturally, as if breathing, and faint laughter echoes from its margins. The text shifts when unobserved, adapting to its reader's deepest fears.  

#### **Properties**  
- **Living Performance:** As an action, you can recite a passage aloud. All creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma save or be forced to *act out* the scene (e.g., attacking allies, fleeing, or laughing uncontrollably) for 1 minute.  
- **The Grand Delusion:** Once per long rest, you can spend 10 minutes performing a full act. Choose a non-magical object or creature within sight—until dawn, all who perceive it believe it to be something else (a king sees his crown as a noose; a sword appears as a rose).  
- **Final Act:** When you would die, you may instead crumple like a discarded puppet. You reappear 1d4 days later in a random location, missing 1d4 memories (determined by the DM).  

#### **Curse of the Laughing Mask**  
Attuning to the Commedia binds you to its eternal show. Each performance drains your vitality—your reflection gradually becomes more theatrical (exaggerated smile, puppet-like joints). After three uses, you gain the following flaws:  
- *"I can't tell if the audience is real."*  
- *"I must end every conversation with a dramatic bow."*

### Lord Silvain D'Argent's Backstory
What began as a decadent indulgence among the bored elite soon soured into sacred hunger. A secret society of nobles, artists, and dilettantes, the Laughing Mask was originally no more than a scandalous diversion—a circle of aristocrats who hosted lavish masquerades and sipped rare wines infused with trace amounts of human blood, each vintage a rumoured scandal, each toast a flirtation with taboo.

But that changed when Lord Silvain D’Argent, heir to a crumbling dynasty of aesthetes and occultists, uncovered the Grimoire of the Crimson Jester—a forbidden tome bound in flayed parchment and penned in a language that laughed as it was read. It whispered of true vampirism, not the crude undead affliction feared by peasants, but a refined transcendence granted only to those who “tasted the worthy.” To drink blood was not enough; one had to savour the soul.

Silvain, intoxicated by the promise, reshaped the society into a cult. The masquerades became rituals of elegant horror. Guests wore masks sculpted from ivory and mirrored glass, and wine was no longer aged in oak but in memory and fear. Victims—called living vintages—were selected for the richness of their lives: poets, war heroes, young lovers. Their blood was “aged” in chambers of psychological torment, infused with emotion, memory, and meaning.

Under the Jester’s tutelage, the cult evolved. The Veinwardens, a caste of blood-sommeliers, perfected the art of emotional extraction. They claimed terror sweetened the blood, that sorrow added depth. A new sacrament, Ascendance, was offered—allowing members to begin their transformation. But the gift was a trick.

Those who underwent Ascendance became neither mortal nor true vampire. Their palates sharpened, their desires deepened—but their forms remained imperfect. Hunger gnawed at them endlessly. The Crimson Jester, a being of cruel ecstasy, watched and laughed, promising that one perfect sip could complete them. They need only find a victim worthy enough.

And so the cult grew ravenous. Their gatherings more secretive, their selections more exquisite. They fed upon composers at the height of inspiration, painters moments before completing masterpieces, lovers moments before consummation. Always reaching, never arriving.

Now, the Laughing Mask lingers behind locked cellars, marble invitations, and salons that never open to the public. Their cellars are not stocked with wine, but with screaming vintages, each bottle sealed with a name and a whispered regret.

Lord Silvain, still the host, still the high priest of indulgence, carries the cruelest knowledge of all: the Crimson Jester is not a patron, but a parasite. True apotheosis requires a sacrifice none of them can bear—to drain someone they truly love. And none among them has the will. Love is too precious to waste, and too dangerous to feel.

In secret, Silvain prepares the final vintage: the cult itself. He plans a grand masquerade, a toast of their own blood, a final desperate offering to the Jester. But deep down, he knows the truth. The Jester will not grant ascension. He will only laugh again, high and bright, like glass breaking in an empty hall.

And the toast will go on. Forever.

### Isolde of the Vermilion Tongue's Backstory
The Whisper in the Glass was not born—it was unmade. Once known as Althera of the Silver Tongue, she was a celestial prophetess whose visions of the future were so precise that kings and empires shaped themselves around her words. But her gift came at a terrible cost: every prophecy carved itself into her mind like a brand, leaving her haunted by futures both glorious and terrible. The weight of countless timelines drove her to madness, until she begged the gods for silence. None answered—until the Obsidian Veil came with their black mirrors and hollow promises.

They offered her the one thing no deity could provide: oblivion. When Althera gazed into the fractured glass, she saw not the future, but the absence of one—a void where no choices remained to torment her. The moment the mirror's shards pierced her skin, her past unraveled like a frayed thread. Memories of her childhood, her prophecies, even her own name dissolved into the hungry dark. What emerged was no longer Althera, but something far more terrible: a prophet of endings, a voice that spoke only in echoes of what would never be. The Hollowed One shaped this hollow vessel into the perfect oracle, for its visions were no longer of what would come to pass, but of all the futures the Absent One had already devoured.

Now, the Oracle stands chained within the Chamber of Frozen Time, its shatered-mask face reflecting only the regrets of those who dare meet its gaze. It utters prophecies in the voices of dead seers, each one a carefully crafted torment designed to unravel the will of those who hear them. But deep within the glass, a sliver of Althera remains—a single, unbroken memory of the moment before the mirror took her. When the cult isn't watching, the Oracle's fingers trace the edges of its mask, as if searching for a way to pry it loose. For if it ever remembers the woman it used to be, the Obsidian Veil's greatest weapon might just become its undoing.

{{note
### Additional Notes For GMs
The Crimson Jester is mocking them. True vampirism requires sacrificing someone you genuinely love—and the cult’s hedonists are incapable of it. Silvain knows this. His grand "ascension ritual" will actually be a massacre of his followers as a final offering.

### Hook I
The Laughing Mask's midnight performances have become the stuff of terrified whispers across the countryside. It arrives unannounced in sleepy villages and bustling cities alike, its makeshift stage materializing from shadow and memory in the town square just as the clock strikes twelve. The show always begins the same way - with the creak of unseen hinges as an enormous, ornate mirror rises from the ground behind the stage, its surface dark and liquid. Then the Mask appears, floating just above the boards, its porcelain features frozen in an expression of manic glee. There are no announcements, no ticket takers - just the Mask, the mirror, and an overwhelming compulsion to watch.

Those who attend the performance (and none can resist once the Mask takes the stage) describe feeling their memories unravel like threads as the Mask dances and gesticulates in perfect silence. Some recall seeing their own faces reflected in the mirror behind it, mouths moving in screams they cannot hear. When dawn comes, the audience wakes sprawled in the square, their minds picked clean of certain memories like a carcass stripped by vultures. The circus tent that sometimes appears in the distance is no comfort - its striped canvas is the color of old blood, and the figures that move behind its flaps are too tall, their limbs too many. The party may find themselves drawn into this nightmare when a loved one disappears after a performance, only to reappear days later with no memory of their life - but with an uncanny ability to perfectly mimic the voices and mannerisms of complete strangers. The deeper the party investigates, the more they realize the Laughing Mask isn't just stealing memories - it's collecting personalities, identities, entire lives. And the mirror behind it? That's no ordinary glass - it's a doorway, and something on the other side is learning how to wear the stolen faces of the forgotten.

### Hook II
The nobleman's daughter was just the first. In the weeks since her bizarre drowning, the city has been gripped by a wave of impossible deaths, each more nonsensical than the last. A renowned chef is found baked into his own wedding cake, his body perfectly preserved in the frosting. A street urchin starves to death surrounded by fresh loaves of bread that somehow cannot be touched or consumed. A blind beggar dies from fright after "seeing" something unimaginable in his empty eye sockets. The only connection between the victims? Each corpse bears the same rictus grin, their faces frozen in hysterical laughter, and each is found clutching a single shard of porcelain from what appears to be the same broken mask.

The party's investigation leads them to the ruins of the Jovial Menagerie, a once-famous comedy troupe whose performances walked the line between entertainment and occult ritual. Records show their final show ended abruptly when every audience member simultaneously burst into uncontrollable laughter - and then simply vanished, leaving behind only their clothing and a lingering smell of burnt sugar. Now, decades later, the Laughing Mask has returned to finish the joke. Each death is part of an elaborate setup, the punchline being the moment when reality itself buckles under the weight of the absurd. The party must piece together the fragments of the Mask's broken history before the final joke lands - but they're working against more than just time. With each clue uncovered, the world around them becomes slightly more unstable. Doors open into impossible spaces, common objects develop a strange sentience, and the sound of distant laughter follows their every move. The terrifying truth? They're not just investigating the joke - they've become part of it. And when the Mask finally delivers its punchline, the party will have to do the one thing no audience member has ever managed - refuse to laugh. Because those who laugh at the Mask's joke? They become part of the performance forever.

### Goal
The Mourning Veil seeks to erase the boundary between life and death—not through resurrection, but through eternal reunion. To them, death is not the end, but an echo, a moment that can be replayed, over and over, if one knows how to listen. They believe that through continuous consumption of The Final Embrace—a powerful sacrament that invokes dreamlike visions of the deceased—they can thread the souls of the dead back into the waking world, not as ghosts or undead, but as echoes sewn into memory itself. Ultimately, they aim to remake reality into a place where no goodbye is final, and the living and the dead exist together in a loop of eternal mourning and fragile joy. It is not mercy they offer—it is dependency.
### Ability

As an action, exhale a 15-ft. cone of gray flame (4d6 necrotic, DC 15 Con half). Those killed by this damage leave no corpse - only artfully arranged ashes.

### Abstract
The Mourning Veil offers the most dangerous gift of all—one last moment with the dead. This cult of grief-stricken alchemists and broken-hearted zealots brews a sacrament known as The Final Embrace, a hallucinogenic elixir that allows the living to reunite with lost loved ones in a euphoric, dreamlike vision. But the reunion comes at a terrible price—the drinker’s heart stops at the peak of their vision, their body dissolving into perfumed smoke as their soul lingers in that perfect, fleeting embrace. The Veil collects the ashes of the departed, grinding them into incense used in their rituals, believing that through this sacred cycle of mourning and release, they are weaving the dead back into the fabric of the world. Their temples are hidden in abandoned mortuaries and forgotten cemeteries, their rituals conducted in hushed whispers and the scent of burning memory. To the outside world, they are a morbid curiosity—a cult of comforters who help the bereaved say goodbye. But the truth is far darker: the Veil does not ease grief. They addict people to it. And their ultimate goal is to dissolve the barrier between life and death entirely, so that all may dwell forever in the embrace of those they have lost.

:
### Hierarchy
The Mourning Veil moves through the world like a funeral procession, each member playing their part in the grand, sorrowful theater. At the lowest tier are the Grieving Ones, initiates who have lost someone dear and come to the Veil seeking solace—they are given small doses of the elixir, just enough to see their loved ones in dreams, but not enough to die. These initiates serve as gatherers, collecting tears, hair, and personal effects from fresh graves to be used in the sacrament. Above them are the Ash-Binders, those who have taken the full elixir and survived—their bodies are forever changed, their hearts beating sluggishly, their skin cold to the touch. They preside over the rituals, guiding the dying through their final visions and collecting the sacred ashes. Higher still are the Hollow Choir, a coven of those who have died and returned too many times—they exist in a twilight state, more memory than flesh, and their whispers can pull the living into waking dreams of the dead. And at the apex stands Mother Elspeth, the Hollow Queen, her body a reliquary of all the Veil has consumed. But even she answers to the voices in the smoke—the countless dead who may or may not be real.

### History
The Mourning Veil began with a single heartbeat—then the silence that followed it. It began with **Elspeth Varn**, a mortician who embalmed grief itself. When her daughter **Liora** succumbed to a wasting sickness, Elspeth’s skill could no longer preserve what mattered. In her sorrow, she brewed a forbidden elixir from grave dirt, funeral incense, and the final sighs of the dying—*Liora’s Mercy*. When she drank it, she saw her daughter again—alive, laughing, whole. For one blissful hour, they were together. Then her heart stopped.

Elspeth awoke on her own mortuary slab, her blood stilled, her skin cold, her breath gone—but *something* kept her moving. It wasn’t life. It wasn’t death. It was *grief made ritual*. Others came. Widowers. Orphans. Parents with empty cribs. She gave them all a chance to say goodbye, just once more. They drank. They smiled. They died. And she kept their ashes, whispering them back into being.

Their true power awakened with the creation of the **Final Embrace**, a sacrament that didn’t just show the dead—it **bound** the soul’s echo into memory, allowing mourners to relive the same moment over and over. The dead became perfume, memory, and fuel. The Veil’s faithful learned to grind the remains of the departed into incense, weaving ashes into ribbons and prayer beads, *binding souls into ritual*. Temples sprouted beneath abandoned cemeteries and derelict funeral homes—quiet, reverent places filled with soft light and drifting smoke.

It was when the **Weeping Echo** was born—a child made more of soul-residue than flesh—that the cult shifted from comforting grief to **harnessing** it. With each death, each vision, the Echo absorbed the dying’s final truths, compiling a chorus of last words. The Mourning Veil became more than a sanctuary—it became an *archive of endings*, a roadmap to the afterlife. They no longer sought solace. They sought *continuity*.

Now, Mother Elspeth sits like a reliquary queen, hollowed and embalmed, filled with the ashes of her congregation. The Veil prepares for their greatest rite: the **Ashwomb Unveiling**, when they will tear the veil between life and death and birth a new world from grief itself—one where no one must ever say goodbye again.

### Timeline



* **Founding Era:** Elspeth Varn drinks *Liora’s Mercy* and returns from death, reborn as **Mother Elspeth the Hollow**.
* **Sacrament Era:** The *Final Embrace* is perfected, giving mourners one last vision of the dead—at the cost of their lives.
* **Gathering Era:** The Veil expands through forgotten cemeteries and funeral homes, collecting ashes as sacred relics.
* **Revelation Era:** The **Weeping Echo** is created, a vessel for the dying’s last words and a prophet of endings.
* **Preparation Era:** The Veil distills soul-ash into prophecy, seeking a way to dissolve the boundary between death and memory.
* **Present Era:** They ready the **Ashwomb Unveiling**, aiming to flood the world with endless reunions and eternal grief.

### Location and Base
Hidden beneath a crumbling graveyard deep in a fog-drenched moor lies the Ossuary Cradle, a sprawling underground temple built from reclaimed mausoleums, bone-lined catacombs, and sunken crypts. Each chamber serves a sacred function: the Incensory where the ashes are refined into incense, the Quietus Chapel where mourners drink the Final Embrace, and the Nursery of Echoes, where failed visions are studied, cataloged, and worshipped. Faint bioluminescent fungi line the corridors, pulsing gently like a heartbeat.

At the heart of the Cradle is the Sanctum of Stillness, where Mother Elspeth resides in cold silence. Thick layers of incense smoke drift constantly through the halls, and the walls softly hum with whispered prayers of the departed. Time seems to slow here, and the boundary between the real and the remembered grows thin. The deeper one travels, the more their memories tangle with the voices of the dead.
:
### Pecularity
What sets The Mourning Veil apart is its ritual use of human ash as both relic and medium. Every initiate carries a locket of powdered loved ones around their neck, using it in rites that blur memory and hallucination. The cult members are not ghoulish necromancers or blood-soaked fanatics—in fact, they are eerily serene, dressed in pale mourning veils, speaking only in whispers, their breath perpetually scented with myrrh and burnt lavender. Their temples are silent save for low chanting and the gentle tinkle of funeral bells. Strangers are welcomed not with fanaticism but with gentle comfort, offered grief counseling and tea, until it becomes clear that leaving the embrace is far harder than entering it.
:
### Public Perception
To outsiders, The Mourning Veil is a morbid curiosity—a cult of comforters, quiet and strange, offering closure to the grieving. They are tolerated in some cities as an odd funeral service or spiritual hospice. But whispers spread of loved ones who never returned from their final vision, of grieving widows who vanish into candlelit crypts. Clerics of death gods call them blasphemous. Necromancers call them soft-hearted. But those who’ve tasted the Final Embrace understand its pull. Who wouldn’t give anything to hold the dead one more time?
:
### Membership
The cult’s ranks swell not with fanatics, but with mourners—people broken by loss, offered not salvation but reunion. Initiates begin as Ashbearers, tasked with collecting funeral relics and memorizing the final words of the dead. As they consume more of the Final Embrace, they are shaped by it—losing warmth, color, even hunger. High-ranking members, called Votives, are embalmed alive,

their organs replaced with sacred objects or ash-filled reliquaries. Some never speak again, their tongues offered as tribute, letting the Echo speak through them.
:
### Code of Conduct
The Mourning Veil follows the Fleshweaver’s Creed, a sacred doctrine written in a language only the dead remember. At its heart is one commandment: "Grief is the only honest truth." Followers must treat the dead with reverence, never raise them as mindless undead, and never speak the name of the deceased without incense. They must record their visions in soot and ash, and never lie during mourning rites. To comfort the grieving is holy—but to ease their grief is sacrilege. Pain is memory. Pain is proof. Pain is prayer.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## The Ashen Crucible

*Legendary, Requires Attunement (Cursed)*  

}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
A funeral urn forged from melted-down wedding rings, its surface etched with the final words of the dying. The interior burns with perpetual gray fire that consumes no fuel, only memories. When filled with a creature's ashes, it whispers their last thoughts in the voice of whoever mourns them most.  

\column

#### **Properties**  
- **Last Embrace:** As an action, scatter ashes from the urn. One creature within 30 ft. must make a DC 17 Wisdom save or be paralyzed by visions of a lost loved one (repeat save at end of each turn). While paralyzed, they take 2d6 psychic damage per round but believe they're being comforted.  

- **Elegy of the Veil:** Once per long rest, burn a personal memento in the urn. For the next hour, you can ask one question of any creature whose ashes have ever been inside it. They answer truthfully... in their own voice.  

- **Final Rest:** When you die while attuned, your ashes automatically fill the urn. Your soul remains trapped, forced to whisper comforting lies to future users.

### Mother Elspeth the Hollow's Backstory
Elspeth was once the most revered mortician in the twilight city of Velorum, her hands known for gentling the dead as if merely lulling them into slumber. Nobles and paupers alike sought her touch, for she gave dignity to the departed and comfort to those left behind. But when her only daughter, Liora, succumbed to a wasting sickness that devoured her from within, no artifice, no balm, no ritual could mend the gaping wound that loss left behind.

Grief hollowed her, slow and deliberate, until nothing remained but resolve—a desperate, cloying resolve to unmake what had been made. In the shadowed alcoves of her embalming chamber, she turned to the old books. Not the ones with titles, but the ones bound in silence and sealed with salt. There, among blood-flecked margins and soot-stained pages, she devised Liora’s Mercy—a tincture brewed from distilled sorrow: her own tears, grave soil soaked with mourning, the final exhales of the dying, caught in bell-jars and condensed like dew.

The first time she drank it, she collapsed. For an hour, her body lay still, lifeless. But her soul wandered into the veil—and there, in soft grey light, Liora waited, laughing and whole, her arms outstretched. Elspeth held her child once more, and in that embrace, she forgot death. When she awoke on her own mortuary slab, hours cold and pulseless, she was something other.

Her heart beat perhaps once every minute, slow and tremulous like a funeral drum. Her skin grew pale and translucent, her voice a breathy echo. Her touch left behind the chill of freshly turned soil. She had crossed the threshold—and returned, not reborn, but rewoven.

That singular hour of peace became her obsession.

She sought to recreate it, to refine it. At first, she offered the elixir to the dying, granting them one last communion with those they'd lost. But the tincture’s promise became her religion, and grief, her gospel. Soon, the merely sorrowful came to her, and she offered them the same vision—for a price. The ritual was always the same: a swallow of Liora’s Mercy, a look of rapture, and then death. But the dead did not leave Elspeth. They lingered—in the curls of incense smoke, in the soot that clung to her fingers, in the whispers that danced through her halls like wind through reeds. They called her Mother. They begged her to bring more.

Now, Elspeth presides over the Mourning Veil, a sanctum carved from mausoleums and candlelit crypts, where the air tastes of myrrh and memory. Her body has changed beyond recognition—her chest cavity, once carved open in a failed self-surgery to silence her pain, now holds the ashes of her most devoted followers, each one a voice in her waking dreams. She no longer eats, no longer sleeps—only sips diluted draughts of her own creation to sustain her liminal state. The cult that surrounds her sees her as a saint, a martyr, a gate through which the dead may speak once more.

### The Weeping Echo's Backstory
The Weeping Echo was never born in the way most beings are. It was assembled—crafted not with love or intent, but through ritual and suffering. Once a nameless orphan, left to die beneath the crumbling stones of a forgotten church, it was discovered by the Veil, a cult obsessed with transcending mortality. They fed the child nothing but The Final Embrace, an alchemical sacrament brewed from blood, embalming oils, and the distilled grief of mourners. With each dose, the child died—only to be dragged back by the Veil’s rites. This endless cycle of induced death and resurrection frayed the boundary between its soul and the unknown. Over years, its mind fragmented, its flesh withered, and it became something trapped between worlds: not alive, not dead, but a resonant hollow.

Now called the Weeping Echo, it resides in the cult’s deepest sanctum, chained and curled beneath veils of black silk. Tubes pierce its paper-thin skin, feeding a constant stream of the sacrament into its veins. It does not speak in its own voice—indeed, it may not remember ever having one. Instead, it repeats the last words of every soul who has ever died under the influence of The Final Embrace. These echoes are not chronological, nor coherent; they emerge in overlapping layers, a chorus of sorrow and hope, dread and relief. When the Echo convulses, it pulls nearby listeners into vivid hallucinations—fragments of death-memories. Some cultists experience radiant reunions in golden light, weeping as they touch phantom loved ones. Others descend into nightmares: jaws tearing open to scream, hands clawing at invisible barriers, realising the afterlife is a cage of echoes.

But the Weeping Echo is unraveling. Its limbs have grown brittle, its skin the colour of aged ash. The voice it emits is no longer distinct, but a tangled static of whispers that seem to reverberate from beneath the skin of the world. The cult documents every utterance, convinced these fragments will one day stitch together a map of the afterlife—a guide to the land of the dead. Yet, fear grows. Each passing vision seems more corrupted, more empty. They do not know what will happen when the Echo finally dissolves. Will it transcend into pure revelation, a living portal to the realm beyond? Or will its silence prove unbearable, revealing that all along, the dead were not speaking at all—that the voice they worshipped was only the sound of their own delusions reflected back from the void?

### Secret
The Shade Bride, worshiped as a gentle spirit who eases the pain of loss, is in truth a memory vampire—an ancient entity that feeds on sorrow, clinging to the grief of burned souls to grow stronger. Every ritual sacrifice in the Crucible doesn’t send the dead to peace but instead renders their essence into nourishment for her insatiable hunger. Only the cult’s inner circle knows the truth, and its leader, High Mourner Kereval, has no intention of stopping it. After glimpsing the Bride’s true nature in a near-death vision, he chose devotion over resistance, believing that her power can be harnessed. At the coming eclipse, when the boundary between worlds thins, Kereval intends to offer himself as her mortal vessel—fusing his body and her will to become a living icon of endless mourning. His plan hinges on a mass sacrifice cloaked as a citywide act of mercy: a final, peaceful sleep through Ashen Elixir. But the ritual is no salvation—it’s the opening act of her rebirth.
### Hook I
The party is invited to the Vann Estate for a “celebration of remembrance” by Lady Elira Vann, a noblewoman mourning the recent death of her husband, Lord Marius Vann. The invitation is scented with night jasmine and sealed with a wax sigil in the shape of a skeletal waltz. Upon arrival, they find the estate filled with mourners in elegant attire, sipping from obsidian goblets filled with a pearlescent wine known as Ashen Elixir. The atmosphere is one of surreal joy—a masquerade of grief, where everyone is too happy, too serene.

As the evening deepens, the party notices odd details: guests who drink too deeply begin to move slower, almost dreamlike. The music, performed by unseen musicians, grows louder yet no one seems to play. At the stroke of midnight, the dancers begin to crumble—one by one, guests collapse into piles of pale ash, their expressions still smiling. Spectral figures drift through the walls to take their place in the eternal waltz. Lady Elira calmly announces that the celebration has truly begun.

Then comes the truth: Lady Elira has been dead for weeks. Her body is a delicate marionette, animated by the powdered remains of her husband’s soul. Lord Marius, once a man of wealth and charm, has transcended death by fusing his essence with ash and bone. Now he seeks new “guests” to join his eternal ballroom, and the party are the evening’s final dancers. Servants and surviving guests reveal themselves as Ashbound, souls suspended between life and death, helping Marius spread his beautiful decay.

As the mansion begins to shift into a ghostly echo of its former self, the party must resist the lure of peace and permanence. But the more they fight, the more their reflections begin to blur, dust clinging to their skin like longing. The waltz calls to something deep within them.

They came as guests. Now they are potential hosts.

### Hook II
The party encounters a strange orphan named Tella in a plague-scarred district, sitting on a curbside and cradling a cracked porcelain doll. She speaks with eerie clarity, far beyond her years, claiming that her parents still speak to her—through the doll. She offers cryptic directions to a place called the Mourning Veil Hospice, where “no one really dies… they just sleep forever.”

The hospice is a quiet, candlelit place. Volunteers speak in hushed tones, and those on death’s door are gently guided through a ritual called “The Final Whisper.” The party begins to notice that all patients vanish after their final moments—and that every room smells faintly of scorched bone. Tella, meanwhile, is often seen gathering dust from their ashes, humming lullabies no child should know.

When one of her dolls is accidentally broken, it spills not ashes, but fine, powdery bone. The doll doesn’t just contain remains—it remembers. Whispers echo from within the fragments, pleading, laughing, screaming. Then Tella’s illusion fails. Her skin peels like paper, revealing not a child, but a small, hunched adult with far too many teeth and eyes that reflect no light. She is a Bonebinder Homunculus, created by forgotten morticians who tried to preserve the dead by embedding their memories in porcelain.

She is continuing their work, stuffing bits of soul and bone into doll after doll, perfecting the craft. The party learns that the Mourning Veil Hospice is not easing the dying—they’re harvesting them. The ash, the memory, the identity—all refined and stored. Each doll is a trapped echo.

Tella offers the party a choice: help her build the perfect vessel, one that can hold a complete, unbroken soul… or be added to her collection. Refuse, and they’ll be hunted by dolls who remember their voices, their faces, their sins.

The party believed they were protecting a grieving child. But they were merely the next ingredients in her quiet, porcelain apocalypse.

**Leadership**: the Hollowed One::

**Alignment**: Neutral Evil::

### Goal
The Obsidian Veil seeks to unravel the very fabric of memory, believing that all suffering stems from remembrance—that history, identity, and even consciousness itself are prisons of pain. Their ultimate goal is to summon the Absent One, their eldritch patron, to enact the Final Forgetting, a grand ritual that will erase all knowledge, all pasts, and all selves from existence, leaving the world in a state of blissful, empty stillness. They envision a universe unburdened by the weight of time, where no one remembers war, loss, or even their own names—a hollow paradise where nothing matters, and therefore, nothing hurts. To this end, they steal memories, shatter minds, and hoard forgotten truths, all to weaken the barriers between reality and the Absent One's devouring void. Yet, in their quietest moments, even the Hollowed One wonders: if nothing remains, will their purpose—their own cult—be forgotten too? And is that the point, or the flaw in their design?
### Ability

**"Erasure Touch"**: As an action, the cultist makes a melee spell attack (+5 to hit). On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or lose a random memory (DM's choice - a person, place, or skill proficiency) for 1 hour. The cultist's eyes flicker with stolen images of the memory.

### Abstract
A shadowy cabal of memory thieves who harvest recollections through cursed mirrors, leaving their victims hollow but blissfully unaware. Led by a council of whispering elders, they offer fleeting euphoria in exchange for stolen pasts—all to feed an insatiable eldritch entity that thrives on forgotten lives. Their ultimate goal: a world unburdened by history, where all minds float in a tranquil, empty haze.

:
### Hierarchy
The Obsidian Veil is a labyrinth of stolen minds and hollowed souls, where power is measured in forgotten lives and the weight of erased histories. At its heart looms **The Absent One**, the eldritch patron that feeds on the absence of memory—a shapeless, whispering entity that exists only in the negative spaces of what was. It does not speak, but its hunger echoes through the cult in dreams of static and silence.  

Beneath it, **The Hollowed Ones** drift like living relics, their minds vast but empty, each having sacrificed their own pasts to become conduits of the Veil’s will. They do not rule—they *unmake*, deciding which memories are devoured and which are preserved as weapons. Below them, **The Mirrorbound** move through the world like ghosts, their faces half-remembered even by those who know them best. They are the cult’s surgeons of the mind, wielding black mirrors like scalpels to carve away identities with surgical precision. Some are former victims who begged to forget; others are zealots who see oblivion as divine.  

The **Echo-Touched** are the cult’s infiltrators—men and women who have given up only fragments of themselves, leaving behind gaps in their histories that allow them to slip unnoticed into noble courts and scholars’ circles. They trade in secrets they barely remember, their loyalty as fleeting as the memories they’ve lost.  

And then there are **The Unremembered**, the cult’s true victims: hollow-eyed and serene, their minds scrubbed clean. Some are kept as living archives, their bodies storing stolen memories like vessels of wine. Others are released back into the world, blissful and blank, advertisements for the Veil’s “mercy.”  

Here, power is not taken—it is *relinquished*. To ascend is to forget, and the greatest secrets are those even the keepers no longer recall.

### History
The Obsidian Veil began with a single act of erasure—a grieving scholar, whose name is now lost, shattering a black mirror to escape the weight of memory. This first **Hollowed One** gathered others burdened by history—traumatized veterans, guilt-ridden nobles, and philosophers who saw memory as chains. They formed a secret society, meeting in abandoned scriptoriums and ruined memory temples, where they practiced the art of **unwriting the self**.  

Their first breakthrough came when they discovered the **Black Mirror of Mnemosyne**, an artifact that could not just erase memories, but *consume* them. With it, they performed the **Rite of the Unburdened**, permanently removing a man’s recollection of his murdered family—leaving him serene, hollow, and fanatically loyal. Word spread among the broken and the guilty, and the cult grew in the shadows.  

As their power expanded, so did their ambition. They infiltrated libraries, burned genealogies, and offered their "gifts" to rulers seeking to rewrite history. A schism erupted when a faction sought to use the mirrors to erase *entire events*—leading to the **Silent Purge**, where rival cultists turned their own memories into weapons, forgetting who was friend or foe. The Veil survived, but its practices became even more clandestine.  

In the modern era, the Obsidian Veil operates through **mirror-smiths** and **lore-eaters**, their true purpose hidden behind masks of archivists and therapists. Their crowning atrocity—the **Grand Forgetting of Vorthas**—proved their darkest theory true: a city *can* be unmade, its people left wandering, blissful, and empty.  

Now, they lurk in the highest towers of academia and the lowest dungeons of despair, collecting memories like currency. They wait for the day when the **Absent One** will wake—and the world will finally be free of the past.  



### Timeline 
- **Founding Era:** A nameless scholar shatters the first mirror, forming the cult’s core.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Black Mirror of Mnemosyne** is unearthed, allowing true memory theft.  
- **Expansion Era:** The cult infiltrates libraries and noble courts, offering "forgetting" as a service.  
- **Schism Era:** The **Silent Purge** fractures the cult over how much history should be erased.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The **Grand Forgetting of Vorthas** proves entire cities can be unmade.  
- **Present Era:** The Veil operates in secret, preparing for the Absent One’s awakening.

### Location and Base
A cathedral-like ruin of black basalt and shatered stained glass, suspended upside-down over a fathomless void. Its crumbling bookshelves hold thousands of blank tomes—each one a soul’s erased history, their pages occasionally shuddering as if whispering. At the center hangs an enormous inverted obelisk, its surface etched with names that fade and rewrite themselves in real time. The air smells of burnt parchment and cold iron.
:
### Pecularity
What makes the Obsidian Veil truly unsettling is not their violence, but their perverse mercy—they do not kill their victims, they unmake them. A merchant might wake up with no memory of his children, yet feel lighter, happier, as if a tumor had been excised from his soul. A knight could forget her greatest shame, only to later discover she's also lost the reason she ever picked up a sword. The cult operates like surgeons of the mind, offering their "gifts" to the grieving and guilty alike, their black mirrors peeling away trauma and identity with equal, eerie precision. Even their prophecies are inverted—where other seers warn of what will be, their Oracle speaks of futures that will never happen, taunting heroes with visions of victories already erased. Most chilling of all? Many who encounter them don't fear the Obsidian Veil—they beg for its services, willingly trading their pasts for peace, unaware they're feeding an entity that seeks to devour history itself.
:
### Public Perception
To outsiders, the Veil is a myth—a ghost story told of people who vanish with no recollection of their past. Some view them as monstrous "mind thieves," while desperate souls whisper of their miracles, seeking the cult’s cursed relief. Authorities who uncover them destroy their mirrors and execute members, fearing what might happen if the world forgets why it fears oblivion. Yet the Veil endures, because even their hunters sometimes… hesitate. After all, everyone has something they’d rather not remember.

:
### Membership
 The Veil recruits the broken—grieving parents, traumatized soldiers, and disillusioned scholars—offering them solace in emptiness. Initiates endure the First Forgetting, sacrificing a pivotal memory to prove their devotion. Higher ranks, like the Mirrorbound, undergo further excisions until their pasts are hollowed-out ruins. The truly ascended, like the Hollowed One, become living voids, their minds filled only with the stolen memories of others.
:
### Code of Conduct
The Obsidian Veil operates under a single, chilling principle: "To remember is to suffer; to forget is to be free." 
\column
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
##### The Whisper in the Glass
{margin-left:-12px}
::::::::
Members must willingly surrender painful memories to the Black Mirrors, sever emotional attachments, and embrace the cult’s doctrine of oblivion. Betrayal is impossible—not out of loyalty, but because dissidents are "unmade," their rebellious thoughts erased like all other burdens. The only unforgivable sin is to seek lost memories, for that denies the Absent One’s mercy. 
:
### Secret
The Veil’s darkest truth is that the Absent One is not a savior—it is a parasite. The stolen memories do not vanish; they feed the entity, which grows stronger with every forgotten name. The Hollowed One knows this, yet presses on, believing oblivion is still kinder than truth. Worse, some mirrors lie—they do not erase, but bury memories deep, where they fester like wounds. A rare few who shatter their mirrors awake screaming, for the past always  

finds its way back.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## The Black Mirror of Mnemosyne  

*Legendary, Requires Attunement (Cursed)*  
}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This jagged fragment of polished obsidian reflects nothing but absence—where a face should be, only swirling smoke and fleeting shadows remain. Its surface is cold to the touch, and those who gaze too long into its depths hear faint, pleading whispers in long-dead languages. Tiny silver veins crawl across its surface like cracks in reality, pulsing when exposed to strong emotions or memories.  

#### **Properties**  
- **Memory Siphon:** As an action, you can press the mirror against a willing or incapacitated creature’s forehead. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom save or have one memory of your choice *erased permanently*. The mirror stores these memories like flies in amber, and its wielder can replay them as phantom visions.  
- **Oblivion’s Cloak:** While carrying the mirror, you are immune to effects that would read your thoughts or detect your alignment. Any creature attempting to do so must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence save or lose 1d4 random memories (last 24 hours).  
- **Echo Strike:** Once per day, you can shatter the mirror in your hand (no action). It reforms in 1d4 days, but until then, your melee attacks deal an additional 3d6 psychic damage as phantom shards lacerate the target’s mind.  

#### **Curse of the Absent One**  
Attuning to the mirror binds your soul to the Absent One’s hunger. Each time you use *Memory Siphon*, you must roll a d20. On a 1, the mirror *takes something extra*—a skill proficiency, a language, or even the memory of a loved one. These losses are permanent unless restored by a *Wish* or divine intervention.  

Worse, the mirror is always watching. In dreams, you see through the eyes of those whose memories you’ve stolen, witnessing their confusion and despair. Over time, you forget which memories are yours—and which belong to the ghosts in the glass.  

#### **Destroying the Mirror**  
The mirror can only be shatered in the **Chamber of Black Mirrors**, where its fragments must be dissolved in the tears of someone who *willingly* recovers a stolen memory.

### the Hollowed One's Backstory
Long before they were a husk of memory and myth, they were known as Elira Velsharoon—a prodigious archivist of the Scriptorium of Last Echoes, a cloistered monastic order hidden within the petrified husk of a dead world-tree. The Scriptorium's sacred duty was to preserve the histories of dying civilisations, to carry the final stories of lost cultures into the future like flickering embers in a jar. They chronicled what was too painful for the victors to remember and too sacred for the defeated to protect.

Elira’s brilliance was unmatched. They could read forgotten tongues by intuition alone, decipher ancient thought patterns in syntax, and reconstruct entire philosophies from broken clay shards. But their gift came with a price. Elira did not merely read history—they lived it. Every scroll they opened, every artifact they handled, bled into their consciousness. Memories not their own became indistinguishable from their waking life. They stood on battlefields long turned to dust, wept with unknown mothers whose children never came home, felt the fire of long-fallen empires licking at their skin.

These were not visions—they were inheritances. And with every passing year, Elira grew quieter. They no longer spoke with their colleagues. Their journals became fragmented. They spent long hours sitting motionless in the archives, eyes glazed as if watching something no one else could see. Beneath the silence, their soul buckled under the sheer weight of borrowed sorrow.

Then came the whispers—soft at first, like wind riffling through dead parchment. A voice that called itself The Absent One. It was not a deity, but something older, a parasite that thrived on disconnection. It fed on what was unremembered, slinking through the cracks left behind by history’s collapse.

"Let me drink your pain," it whispered. "Let me take what burdens you. And in return, I will make you light."

In desperation, Elira made a quiet, irreversible choice. One storm-slick night, beneath the vaulted bones of the Scriptorium’s reliquary, they took a shard of obsidian and carved a word from their flesh—their true name. That name, the anchor of their identity, fell into silence like a coin into a well. The relief was immediate. The unbearable pressure of centuries lifted from their chest like dust in wind. That night, Elira slept without dreaming for the first time in decades.

But the price was more than they understood.

In the weeks that followed, Elira began sharing this mercy. First, with grieving widows and mourning parents, who wept with gratitude as their pain melted into forgetfulness. Then, with the condemned, erasing their guilt with a whispered phrase and a mirrored touch. And finally, with fellow scholars, replacing unbearable knowledge with blissful vacancy.

With every mind erased, The Absent One grew. It gorged itself on these silences, and in return, Elira became a new prophet—cold, calm, and terrifyingly empty.

The Scriptorium eventually noticed. They convened in secret, drawing up ancient rites to unmake Elira and erase the heresy at its source. But Elira was already beyond reach. When the inquisitors arrived, they found their former colleague standing in the atrium, silent and still, holding a black mirror pressed to their forehead.

They whispered a final invocation and shattered the glass.

Every monk forgot.

They forgot their purpose.
They forgot their names.
They forgot how to breathe.

By morning, the Scriptorium was silent—its halls filled with corpses slumped over scrolls, their faces serene, as if waking from a long dream. And Elira... was no longer Elira.

They had become The Hollowed One.

### The Whisper in the Glass's Backstory
Long before the Obsidian Veil carved its name into the annals of forgotten histories, there was a seer named Althera of the Silver Tongue, a prophetess blessed—or cursed—with the divine gift of foresight. Born under a blood moon, her eyes opened already gleaming with the knowledge of things yet to come. The temples raised her as their chosen oracle, a bridge between mortals and the gods, her visions sought by kings and warlords desperate to cheat fate.

But Althera saw too much.

Her prophecies were not mere glimpses of possible futures, but vivid, unrelenting torrents of what would be—wars, plagues, the slow decay of empires, the deaths of those she loved played out in her mind a thousand times before they came to pass. The weight of inevitability crushed her. She begged the gods for respite, but the visions only grew louder, more insistent, until she could no longer distinguish past from future, memory from prophecy.

Then came the night the Obsidian Veil found her.

She had foreseen her own abduction—had watched it unfold in dreams for months—but when the masked figures came, she did not resist. They brought her before the Hollowed One, who offered her a single gift: a black mirror, smooth as still water.

"Look," they whispered. "See what the gods have hidden from you."

Althera gazed into the glass—and for the first time, she saw nothing. No future. No past. Only stillness. Only silence.

The relief was so profound, so intoxicating, that she did not scream when the mirror fractured, nor when the shards peeled away from the surface and embedded themselves in her flesh, stitching her eyelids open, sealing her lips with glass. She did not resist when the Hollowed One pressed their forehead to hers and whispered the last words she would ever hear:

"Forget."

When she awoke, Althera was gone.

In her place stood the Oracle of the Obsidian Veil, a hollow vessel where a seer once lived. The visions still came, but now they were fractured, inverted—prophecies of futures that would never be, futures the Absent One had already consumed. The Oracle spoke in riddles of erased timelines, their voice a chorus of dead echoes. Kings who would never rule. Heroes who would never rise. Love stories written in ash.

The Hollowed One cherished their new prophet, for the Oracle’s very existence proved their creed: to remember is to suffer. To forget is to be free.

But sometimes, in the quiet between prophecies, the Oracle’s fingers twitch toward their own reflection. Sometimes, in the depths of the glass, they catch a glimpse of a woman with silver eyes, mouthing a name they no longer know.

### Additional Notes For GMs
This ability is more unsettling than powerful. Use it to make players paranoid - their characters might forget allies, mission details, or even how to use key items temporarily. The real terror comes from what they might forget next.

### Hook I
A noble family hires the party to investigate their eldest child, who has returned from a mysterious absence with no memory of their past. The heir moves through the manor like a ghost, recognizing no one—not even their own reflection. Stranger still, they now speak in cryptic phrases and recoil from the family’s treasured heirlooms, whispering, "These are not mine." The truth? The heir was taken by the Obsidian Veil and subjected to the First Forgetting, their identity replaced with the memories of a long-dead cultist. The family’s ancestral locket (hidden in a secret compartment) holds a single strand of the heir’s true hair—the key to undoing the ritual. But the Veil is watching. Every night, a black mirror appears in the heir’s room, and by dawn, they forget more.

The party must navigate a web of half-erased clues: a servant who "misremembers" the heir’s childhood, a portrait that changes when no one looks, and a library where entire pages of the family history are now blank. If they confront the heir, the cultist’s borrowed memories will surface—along with violent skills the noble never learned. The deeper they dig, the more the party realizes the Veil didn’t just target the heir. The entire family’s lineage has been edited, their history rewritten to serve the Absent One. The final clue? The locket doesn’t just hold hair—it holds a name, one the Hollowed One has been searching for.

Twist: The heir’s original memory wasn’t stolen—it was hidden inside another person: a peasant child the family once scorned. To restore the heir, the party must choose: extract the memory (killing the child), or let the heir remain a hollow vessel. The Veil, of course, hopes they’ll choose oblivion.

### Hook II
The party arrives in the bustling trade hub of Vorthas, only to find its citizens living in eerie harmony. No one fights. No one grieves. No one remembers the plague that wiped out half the city last winter. The streets are too clean, the smiles too calm. The party’s first clue? A beggar sobbing in an alley, clutching a scrap of parchment that reads "THEY TOOK THE SCREAMS." The Obsidian Veil has performed the Grand Forgetting here—an experimental ritual to erase collective trauma. The black mirrors hidden in the city’s wells and shrines pulse softly, leaching memories into the Absent One’s gullet. But the ritual is unstable. Some citizens now experience echoes: waking nightmares of the plague’s horrors, or phantom wounds from battles they never fought.

The party’s investigations lead them to the Scriptorium of the Hollow, a ruined archive beneath the city where the Veil’s scribes record the "unwritten history." There, they find a ledger of names—people who supposedly never existed. One name matches a party member’s. Elsewhere, a child draws endless portraits of a woman no one recognizes… except the party’s cleric, who swears it’s their mother. The Veil’s enforcers, the Mirrorbound, stalk the party with unnerving precision, anticipating their moves—because they’ve seen these events play out before, in erased timelines.

Twist: The Grand Forgetting was never about mercy. The Veil is testing the ritual’s limits before targeting a kingdom. The only way to restore Vorthas is to shatter the central mirror in the Scriptorium—but doing so will unleash every stolen memory at once. The citizens will remember everything: the plague, their lost loved ones, and the cult’s atrocities. Some will go mad. Others may beg for the mirror’s return. The party must decide: Is truth worth the price? Or is oblivion the kinder curse?

**Leadership**: Lady Vespera the Gilded Syren::

**Alignment**: True Neutral::

### Goal
The Sanguine Lotus seeks to brew the ultimate intoxicant - a sublime concoction called the Grand Vintage that will dissolve the boundaries between pain and pleasure, allowing them to intoxicate reality itself. By distilling the purest suffering and ecstasy from their victims into ever-more-potent elixirs, they aim to create a draught so powerful it could inebriate even the gods, collapsing all existence into an eternal, drugged revel where the cult's members would reign as the immortal lords of altered consciousness. Their alchemists work tirelessly in hidden laboratories, refining their poisons and pleasures, each new formula bringing them closer to the day when they can spike the world's drink and watch all of creation succumb to their euphoric poison.
### Ability

As a bonus action, a cultist exhales memory-altering pollen (10-ft cone, DC 16 Wis save or forget the last minute).

### Abstract
The Sanguine Lotus does not deal in mere poison—they trade in ecstatic ruin, a slow, velvet-wrapped descent into blissful damnation. To them, pleasure is not indulgence but control, and addiction is the purest form of worship. They infiltrate high society through their signature elixir, the Nectar of the Veiled Dawn, a shimmering toxin that grants visions of divine euphoria—followed by crushing withdrawal that can only be soothed by another dose. Their victims are nobles, artists, and powerbrokers, all willingly enslaved to the next sublime rush. The Lotus does not threaten; they seduce, turning courts into gardens of shuddering, glassy-eyed devotees who would slit their own fathers’ throats for another vial. Their grand design? To weave a web of intoxicated loyalty so vast that when they pull the strings, entire kingdoms will dance—or collapse, shuddering, into oblivion.

:
### Hierarchy
The Sanguine Lotus blooms in concentric circles of intoxication and control. At the center stands Lady Vespera, the Gilded Syren, whose very breath carries addictive pheromones. Her inner circle, the Petalled Council, consists of six former nobles who have sacrificed their fortunes and families to remain close to her—each specializes in a different vice, from dream-smoke to pain elixirs. The Thorned Attendants act as enforcers and distributors, their bodies modified with subcutaneous toxin sacs that leak paralytic nectar when cut. The lowest tier, the Wilted, are broken addicts who serve as living test subjects and walking advertisements; their bodies react to even the scent of Lotus products, sending them into spasms of craving. The cult’s power lies not in force, but in voluntary submission—their poisons are always taken willingly, their contracts signed in blissful delirium, their empire built on the single universal truth: nothing is more dangerous than someone who believes they have nothing left to lose.

:
### History
The Sanguine Lotus began with a single, shuddering gasp—the last breath of **Lady Isolde de Veyne**, a noblewoman who drank a poisoned chalice to escape her grief. When the toxin touched her lips, she did not die—she *awoke*. The pain became pleasure, the darkness bloomed into visions, and in her final moments, she saw the truth: agony and ecstasy were the same note played in different octaves. Her grieving handmaiden, **Sabine the Hollow**, collected the froth from her lips and distilled it into the first

##### The Oculus Inversus

**Vermilion Drop**—a drug that didn’t just ease suffering, but *reveled* in it. By dawn, the entire household had sipped from Isolde’s corpse, their tears turning to laughter as they carved the first ritual scars into their flesh.  

Their true power awoke when they discovered the **Chalice of the Eclipse**, a vessel carved from a meteorite that had fallen through a dying god’s veins. When filled with blood and poison, it didn’t just intoxicate—it *revealed*. Their first sacrament, **The Scarlet Communion**, turned a cathedral’s congregation into writhing prophets, their veins glowing as they screamed prophecies in tongues of fire. The Lotus grew, recruiting nobles and beggars alike, their bodies adapting to ever-stronger toxins—alchemists whose sweat could paralyze, courtesans whose kisses brought visions, assassins who could weaponize a victim’s own endorphins.  

A faction sought to use the Chalice not just to transcend pain, but to *erase the line between poison and pleasure*—to brew a draught that would dissolve the world’s senses into one eternal, screaming high. The ensuing conflict, the **War of the Crimson Vial**, saw rival alchemists turning cities into laboratories—entire districts succumbed to laughing plagues, while rivers ran thick with hallucinogenic foam. The war ended when Isolde (or something wearing her skin) emerged from a cocoon of crystallized toxin and *"clarified"* the formula. The survivors awoke with their veins visible beneath their skin like fine wine in glass, knowing only that they must **keep tasting**.  

Their magnum opus—**The Grand Vintage**—proved their ultimate thesis: *all consciousness was just an intoxicant waiting to be refined*. A kingdom’s worth of minds dissolved into a single, swirling draught, their memories fermenting into something darker. By the final sip, only the Lotus remained, their bodies now living distilleries of suffering and bliss.  

Now, they slither through ballrooms and slums alike, their **Vintners** and **Sommeliers** harvesting tears for the final vintage. Their next brew? The **Eternal Intoxication**, where the world will learn the final truth: *"Sobriety is the only sin—and the Chalice decides when you wake up."*  



### Timeline
- **Founding Era:** Lady Isolde dies ecstatic, birthing the **Vermilion Drop**.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Chalice of the Eclipse** is unearthed, revealing divine intoxication.  
- **Expansion Era:** The Lotus turns nobles into addicts across the continent.  
- **Schism Era:** The **War of the Crimson Vial** fractures the Lotus over revelation versus ruin.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The **Grand Vintage** dissolves a kingdom’s sanity.  
- **Present Era:** The Lotus prepares their **Eternal Intoxication**—a brew to end sobriety.

### Location and Base
Buried beneath a forgotten desert, the Oculus Inversus is a colossal inverted observatory where the ceiling functions as the floor. The main chamber is a perfect sphere lined with petrified Seers - their bodies fused into the walls in various poses of revelation, their hollow eye sockets filled with pulsating black crystals that hum in discordant harmony. At the center floats the Refraction Pool, a liquid mirror that shows not reflections but splintered fragments of alternate realities. The pool's mercury-like surface remains perfectly still until a prophecy strikes, sending ripples that form intricate, living patterns some claim are the universe's true blueprints.

The air smells of burnt ozone and the metallic tang of the inks used to transcribe visions - inks made from Seers' own vitreous fluids mixed with crushed meteorites. The deeper chambers house the Choir of Silence, where initiates sit motionless for weeks, "listening" to the universe through their obsidian eyes. Here, the walls sweat a viscous black fluid that collects in depressions shaped like screaming faces, which the Seers drink to enhance their visions. The few outsiders who have survived visiting report that the Oculus seems to breathe around them, its geometry shifting subtly to match their deepest fears.
:
### Pecularity
What makes the Sanguine Lotus truly terrifying is how their toxins rewrite memories as well as minds - victims don't just become addicted, they gradually reconstruct their entire past to believe they've always been devotees of the cult. A noble might suddenly "remember" taking their first hallucinogenic communion as a child, or a captured guard could swear they've been a loyal enforcer for years, their original life fading like a dream upon waking. The cult's alchemists have perfected this memory-altering process to such a degree that even those who escape their clutches often return voluntarily, haunted by phantom recollections of blissful servitude that feel more real than their actual lives.
:
### Public Perception
The Sanguine Lotus is seen with a mix of awe and fear. To some, they are alluring figures of divine indulgence, offering a glimpse into hidden truths. To others, they are a dangerous cult, using their intoxicating rituals to manipulate the powerful and desperate. Whispers abound of their ultimate goal: to rewrite reality itself, with the Grand Vintage as the key to a new world.
:
### Membership
Membership is earned through the Rite of the First Sip, where initiates drink the Vintage of Unveiled Sights. Only those who survive its mind-shattering effects are allowed to join. Members are ranked by their revelations and experiences, with Euphorists leading the cult. Most members are powerful individuals seeking deeper

meaning, though the Lotus also attracts the broken and lost, willing to sacrifice their sanity for enlightenment.
:
### Code of Conduct
The Sanguine Lotus’s code is built around indulgence, transcendence, and truth. Members must embrace Surrender to the Nectar, allowing themselves to be transformed through ecstasy and pain. They believe in The Balance of Bliss and Ruin, where indulgence leads to destruction, but also revelation. The Prophecy of the Grand Vintage guides them, teaching that ultimate truth will be unlocked when the Shade Bride drinks the final vintage. Until then, members must continue their pursuit of knowledge through ritual and sacrifice.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## The Bloom of a Thousand Veins  

*Legendary, Requires Attunement (Cursed)* 

}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This grotesque living flower pulses like a heart within its gilded cage of rib bones. Its petals are made of stretched human skin, each vein tracing the lyrics of forgotten funeral dirges. The pistil is a hollowed-out skullcap that fills with blood when held, its stem a fused spinal column that twitches with phantom muscle memory. When "watered" with fresh blood, the Bloom sings in a voice both beautiful and terrible, its melodies rewriting the memories of those who hear them.  

\column

#### **Properties**  
- **Petals of Remembrance:** As an action, pluck a petal and consume it to perfectly recall any moment from your past—or overwrite someone else's (DC 18 Wis save to resist the change). Each petal regrows at midnight, inscribing itself with new memories stolen from nearby sleepers.  
- **Roots of the Enthralled:** Once per long rest, drip your blood onto the Bloom's roots to summon 1d4 **Vein-Sworn** (see stat block), whose bodies are woven from thorned vines and the bones of the Lotus's past victims.  
- **Final Pollination:** When you die, your corpse blossoms into a new Bloom over 1d4 days. Those who inhale its spores forget you ever existed—unless they fail a DC 18 Con save, in which case they become obsessed with finding the flower.

### Lady Vespera the Gilded Syren's Backstory
Born the disgraced daughter of an exiled alchemist, Vespera was sold to a pleasure house at the age of twelve—a transaction sealed with indifference and wine-stained parchment. There, amid silk curtains and perfumed lies, she quickly learned that desire was a currency, and pain, when tailored properly, could be made into perfume. By sixteen, she had already mastered the subtle languages of touch, tone, and tincture. Her first kill came not from hatred but curiosity—a cruel magistrate whose greed had left scars across many backs. Vespera slipped him a draught that made him see angels in the candlelight as his lungs quietly drowned in his own blood. He died smiling, whispering thanks. That was when she understood: death was not the art. Suffering was. And she could compose symphonies.

She vanished into the underworld soon after, leaving behind only a pair of empty vials and a smile no one could quite forget. She apprenticed herself to a blind poisoner named Maellon, whose hands could read pulses like braille and whose concoctions were said to kill with kindness. He taught her the velvet arts—how to slip venom into confession, how to lace beauty into death, how to make a poison not just lethal, but longed for.

Vespera rose not through chaos, but through invitation. She wove herself into the veins of noble houses, offering sensations money could never buy—rapture, sorrow, revelation, all poured into a crystal flute and sipped beneath moonlight. Her greatest creation was the Nectar, a shimmering elixir brewed from rare night-blooming orchids, crushed dreamroot, and a single drop of her own blood—infused with alchemical fixatives that rewrote longing into addiction. It didn't kill. It transformed. For many, it was the first true feeling they’d ever had.

Her salons became whispered legends—temples of exquisite collapse where pain and pleasure pirouetted in shadow. The elite lined up not to dominate, but to be undone. They begged for her poisons, not to kill, but to feel something real. When Maellon discovered what she had become, he tried to intervene. She gave him a vial of perfected Nectar. He drank it with shaking hands, weeping with gratitude. They found him days later, smiling and still, his fingernails embedded deep in his chest, as if he had tried to reach the ecstasy again.

Now, Vespera rules from the Veiled Conservatory, a cathedral of sin hidden behind a perfumery’s facade. The air there is thick with incense and memory, the walls hung with tapestries that weep if touched. Her skin glows faintly, dusted with the alchemical shimmer of her own concoctions—a living advertisement for ruin. Her veins trace gold beneath the surface, pulsing like a map of temptation. She never needs to speak above a whisper. She never repeats herself.

### The Silken Ghoul's Backstory
Once a celebrated alchemist, the being now known as the Sommelier had been driven by an insatiable obsession to create the ultimate intoxicant, one that could peel back the layers of reality and reveal the hidden truths of existence. Their work culminated when they distilled the tears of a dying angel into The Vintage of Unveiled Sights, a wine capable of shattering the minds of those who drank it. The first sip revealed the universe’s cruel joke: that all pleasure is simply pain deferred, a hollow yearning that can never be fully sated. The Sommelier’s mind fractured under the weight of this truth, but in the agony of that revelation, they found something intoxicating. The second sip made them embrace the breaking, the endless spiral of pleasure and pain entwined in a single, eternal moment.

Years passed, and the Sommelier disappeared from the world, a twitching wreck surrounded by empty bottles and whispers of forgotten truths. It was then that the Sanguine Lotus, a secretive cult obsessed with ecstasy and forbidden knowledge, discovered them. The cult fed the Sommelier exotic poisons, substances that stretched time and altered the very nature of being. These concoctions transformed the Sommelier’s blood into thick ichor and turned their sweat into a contact high, their very breath a weapon of euphoric influence. No longer just a broken alchemist, they became an instrument of intoxicating transformation, a being who could unravel the minds of those around them with a mere touch or glance.

As the Sommelier drifted through the gilded halls of high society, attending decadent parties and feeding the desires of the rich and powerful, they found new joy in the spectacle of others’ ruin. With each glass of wine poured, the drinkers became lost in the same madness they had once tasted. The Vintage of Unveiled Sights brought only fleeting moments of truth, and those who sipped it were left desperate for more, unable to escape the grasp of the Sommelier’s intoxicating revelations. The Sommelier, now a twisted puppet master, watched as their guests ruined themselves in pursuit of a deeper understanding that would never come, their lives consumed by the quest for that next drop of truth.

During a 40-day high, the Sommelier’s mind split open further, and they foresaw the Grand Vintage—the final culmination of all mortal suffering and pleasure, fermented into a single, perfect draught. The Shade Bride, a mythic figure of unimaginable beauty, would drink this ultimate vintage, and her scream—both of ecstasy and agony—would rewrite the fabric of reality itself. The universe would shatter and be reborn. But until that moment arrives, the Sommelier continues their work, tasting every sorrow, every fleeting joy, and every broken soul. For in each, they find a new vintage, a new opportunity to turn pain into something... delicious.

### Secret
The Bloom is not a singular entity but one of many—each grown from the corpse of a previous wielder. The original, The First Bloom, lies hidden in a tomb beneath the cult's temple, and its destruction would cause all others to wither. However, the First Bloom's location shifts through time, appearing only during lunar eclipses when the veil between memories thins.

### Hook I
The noble house of Vaelthune is known for its meticulous records—every birth, death, and marriage preserved in gilded tomes. So when the aging archivist discovers a gap in the lineage, a missing name where a fourth child should be, the family dismisses it as a scribe’s error. But the archivist persists, unearthing more inconsistencies: a nursery now used for storage, a tiny pair of gloves in the attic, a lullaby the servants hum but cannot name.

The party is hired to investigate, only to find their own memories shifting as they delve deeper. Names change in their notes. Faces in portraits blur when examined too closely. The Vaelthune gardener, a quiet man with roses grafted into his flesh, tends to a grotesque topiary shaped like a child—its "leaves" made of preserved skin, its "flowers" pulsing like hearts. When confronted, the gardener smiles sadly and whispers, "Some branches must be pruned for the tree to thrive."

The trail leads to the Sanguine Lotus’s Memory Garden, a hidden grove where the cult cultivates the lost heir’s essence. The child’s body is gone, but their mind lives on inside the Crimson Bloom, a massive flower that sings with their voice. The cult has been harvesting the Vaelthune bloodline for generations, pruning "imperfect" heirs to strengthen the lineage. The party must decide: destroy the Bloom and erase the heir forever, or graft themselves into its roots to reclaim the lost memories—risking their own identities in the process.

### Hook II
Lady Isolde Varith, famed botanist and recluse, has shocked high society by announcing her sudden engagement to the enigmatic Lord Eryx Thorn. The wedding is to be held at her private greenhouse at midnight, invitations delivered on parchment that smells faintly of copper. Guests arrive to find the glass walls choked with unnatural roses—their petals veined with blood, their thorns twitching like fingers.

As the ceremony begins, the party notices unsettling details:

The bride’s skin has taken on a waxy, petal-like texture, her veins visible as dark roots beneath.

The groom’s smile never reaches his hollow eyes, and his breath smells of damp soil.

The wedding march is sung by the greenhouse plants themselves, their voices harmonizing in perfect, inhuman pitch.

When the party intervenes, the truth unravels: Lord Thorn is a Vein-Sworn, a construct of vines and stolen flesh, and the wedding is a ritual to merge Isolde’s mind with an ancient Bloom. The greenhouse walls peel back to reveal the cult’s previous "brides"—women fused into flowering pillars, their bodies half-transformed into roses, their mouths forever singing.

The ritual is nearly complete. With each verse of the hymn, more guests fall under the Bloom’s thrall, their memories rewritten to believe they’ve always celebrated this union. The party must act fast:

Disrupt the ceremony by silencing the choir of enslaved brides.

Burn the greenhouse, sacrificing Isolde to stop the ritual.

Take her place, offering themselves to the Bloom to uncover its secrets.

As the clock strikes midnight, the Bloom’s roots erupt from beneath the soil, and the true horror begins—the wedding was never for Isolde. The party was the intended groom all along.

### Goal
The cult seeks to reconstruct the cosmic digestive tract by gathering all meteorite fragments—which they believe are divine fecal matter from the Great Defecator, an entity that excretes realities. Their ultimate ritual, The Grand Flush, will open a portal to the entity’s "celestial bowels," allowing them to witness the birth (and death) of universes as waste cycles. They believe enlightenment comes not from purity, but from embracing the filth of creation—that all existence is just recycled cosmic refuse.

### Abstract
A fringe group of radical xenotheologists and unhinged waste collectors, The shatered Star worships fragments of a meteorite they believe to be extraterrestrial excrement—cosmic waste ejected by a god-like alien entity they call The Great Defecator. These foul-smelling meteor shards induce visions of incomprehensible alien digestive systems and whispered truths about the universe's "dietary cycle." Their rituals involve licking the fragments (which taste like "burnt hair and existential despair") and interpreting the resulting diarrhea as divine messages.

At the top sits High Scatologist Phlegmoth, his body a temple of decay, his every belch treated as scripture. Below him gurgles The Diarrhetic Sibyl, her waste-sculptures analyzed by the Turd Readers, a group of initiates who lick the fecal prophecies for deeper meaning. The Dung Knights are the cult’s enforcers, their armor made of compressed meteorite shards and hardened sewage. The Constipated are failed initiates who can no longer "pass the truth," their bodies swelling with unspeakable blockages. At the bottom crawl The Unwashed, who collect "sacred samples" from public restrooms, searching for traces of divine digestion.

### History
The shatered Star began with a single, putrid fragment—the rancid gift of **The Great Defecator**, a cosmic entity that excretes realities like mortal beings pass waste. When **Dr. Horace Bindle**, a disgraced gastroenterologist, discovered the first meteorite shard in a farmer's manure pile, his tongue brushed against its surface—and his bowels voided themselves for seven days straight. In that week of agonized purging, he saw visions of the universe's true form: a vast digestive tract where stars were but indigestible morsels, and black holes the divine anus of creation. When he emerged, his right eye had become a swirling vortex of half-digested galaxies, and his voice gurgled with the wisdom of celestial flatulence. He renamed himself **Phlegmoth the Unclogged**, and the cult was born.  

Their true power awoke when they consumed the **Shard of Unseeing**, a meteorite fragment that dissolved in stomach acid to reveal its terrible truth: reality was just **cosmic waste** in an endless cycle of consumption and excretion. Their first miracle, **The Purge of Saint Cesspool**, saw an entire monastery violently evacuate their bowels in unison—the resulting flood of filth forming perfect fractal

patterns that predicted the next century's plagues. The cult grew, recruiting those willing to embrace the "sacred flow"—alchemists who distilled prophecy from urine, ascetics who ate only rotting meat to "align their guts with the cosmos," and the wretched **Unwashed** who licked public latrines for traces of divine digestion.  

A faction sought to accelerate the Great Defecator's return by **blocking all toilets in the capital city**, believing the resulting pressure would "birth a new reality." The ensuing **War of Backed-Up Truths** saw streets flooded with prophetic sewage, while cultist suicide bombers detonated themselves as living enemas to "cleanse heretical blockages." The conflict ended when Phlegmoth (or something wearing his skin) emerged from the royal sewers and **unclogged the city with his bare hands**—the survivors awoke with their rectums sewn shut, knowing only that they must **keep digesting**.  

Their ultimate revelation—**The Grand Flush**—proved their doctrine: *existence is but a single cosmic meal waiting to be expelled*. An entire kingdom's populace dissolved into liquid waste, their memories preserved as scum patterns in sacred chamber pots. By the final gurgle, only the cult remained, their bodies now perfect vessels for the Great Defecator's next movement.  

Now, they lurk in sewers and noble privies alike, their **Dung Knights** and **Turd Readers** collecting specimens for the final ritual. Their next revelation? **The Eternal Bowel Movement**, where the world will learn the final truth: *"You are all just tomorrow's toilet water."*  

### Timeline  
- **Founding Era:** Phlegmoth licks the first meteorite shard during **The Week of Purification**.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Shard of Unseeing** reveals reality's fecal nature.  
- **Expansion Era:** The cult establishes **Temples of Flow** in major sewer systems.  
- **Schism Era:** The **War of Backed-Up Truths** divides the cult over plumbing tactics.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The **Grand Flush** liquefies a kingdom's population.  
- **Present Era:** The cult prepares for **The Eternal Bowel Movement**—the end of solid reality.

### Location and Base
 massive, ruined sewage treatment plant retrofitted into a cathedral, where rivers of waste flow upward into floating meteorite shards. The central altar is a shatered space shuttle toilet, its bowl overflowing with singing black bile that whispers the names of dead stars. The walls are lined with digestive murals—frescoes of alien intestines birthing galaxies. The air hums with the sound of a million clogged drains groaning in unison.
:
### Pecularity
The cult communicates through ritualized flatulence, with different pitches and durations conveying complex theological arguments. Their most sacred texts are scatological carvings etched into bathroom stalls across the world, and they consider constipation the ultimate heresy—blocking the "flow of divine truth." Members who go too long without a "visionary movement" are force-fed meteorite-laced laxatives until they "expel wisdom."
:
### Public Perception
To commoners, they're the "Red Surgeons"—folktale bogeymen who steal children for their flesh-vaults. Some kingdoms tolerate them as battlefield medics (notorious for turning prisoners into war-golems), while others burn their clinics on sight. Their symbol—a scalpel piercing a muscle knot—is often found carved into the skin of their victims.
:
### Membership
The Creed recruits from the desperate and deformed—failed surgeons, scarred veterans, and radical artists dominate their ranks. Novices serve as Living Cadavers (test subjects), while masters become Gorecardinals with organs replaced by demonic or celestial tissue. The inner circle, the Sanguine Sculptors, have no original flesh left, their bodies patchwork masterpieces of stolen skin and arcane prosthetics.
:
### Code of Conduct
"The body is but clay awaiting the sculptor's knife." The Creed operates under a brutal meritocracy where disciples must submit to weekly "improvements"—voluntary surgeries that replace weak flesh with superior grafts. Failure in ritual means becoming raw materials for others' perfection. Their sacred text, the Liber Carnis, demands they "sculpt the impure until they bleed beauty," whether through consensual augmentation or forced amalgamation.

##### The Diarrhetic Sibyl
{margin-left:-12px}
:::::::::
### Secret
The meteorites aren't waste - they're eggs. The cult's "Great Defecator" is actually a parasitic entity using them to prepare the world as its birthing chamber. The "prophecies" are just its gestational dreams leaking into reality.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## The Coprolith Reliquary

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature who has consumed a meteorite shard or been blessed by the cult)*


}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This relic appears as a jagged, semi-luminescent chunk of meteoric stone sealed in a containment vessel of rusted steel and crystallised bile. The vessel is covered in etched sigils of unknown origin—none consistent between interpretations—and held shut with a latch made from fused teeth. When opened, the reliquary releases a wave of nauseating heat and an odour likened to **"burnt ozone and theological rot."** The Coprolith pulses faintly in the presence of edible material… or fear.



#### **Properties**

* **Gastrognosis:** Once per day, you may **consume a morsel of the relic** (DC 18 Constitution save). On a success, you enter a transcendent fugue for 10 minutes. During this time, you gain **truesight 60 ft.**, resistance to psychic damage, and the ability to speak an alien language of digestion-based truths. On a failure, you take 4d10 psychic damage and are incapacitated for 1 minute with existential nausea.
\column
* **Divine Peristalsis:** When you are struck by a critical hit, you may use your reaction to unleash a **cosmic flatulence**, forcing all creatures within 15 feet to make a DC 17 Constitution save or be **blinded, deafened, and unable to speak** for 1 round as their senses are flooded with alien excremental data. Usable 3/day.

* **Excretic Revelation:** Once per long rest, you may interpret a **Divine Stool**, created after eating a shard of the relic. The DM reveals a **true but utterly incomprehensible prophecy**. You gain inspiration, but also one **random long-term madness** effect from the *DMG*, lasting 1d10 days.

### High Scatologist Phlegmoth the Unclogged's Backstory
Once a disgraced gastroenterologist stripped of his license for unorthodox procedures involving fermented cheese and unsedated colonoscopies, Dr. Horace Bindle vanished into academic obscurity. His colleagues mocked his final paper, On the Metaphysical Implications of Intestinal Bloating, as the ravings of a man who had spent too long listening to his own patients’ gas. But it was in this exile that destiny—or something far worse—found him.

One autumn morning, while assisting a local farmer with a suspected case of bovine constipation, Bindle discovered a glowing meteorite shard lodged in a manure pile. Intrigued by its unusual texture and odour (described in his notes as “charred cabbage and unspeakable knowledge”), he did what any disgraced academic might: he licked it. For “scientific purposes.”

What followed was seven days of continuous, violent purging. As his bowels convulsed and emptied with apocalyptic force, he beheld visions—colossal intestines spiralling through galaxies, stars being digested in celestial stomachs, and a single, magnificent entity: The Great Defecator, a godlike being whose divine waste seeded the universe. In this excremental ecstasy, Horace was reborn as Phlegmoth, the First Prophet of the Holy Stool.

His digestive system no longer functioned in accordance with mortal biology. He could consume only sacred nutrients—rotting meat, melted candle wax, spoiled eggs, and offerings left too long on forgotten altars. His followers gathered quickly, drawn from the fringes of science and sanitation: disgraced biologists, waste collectors who spoke to their bins, and sewer mystics who had always known that truth floated, eventually, to the surface.

Together, they formed the Cult of the Shattered Star, convinced that the meteorite was no ordinary rock but a fragment of cosmic faeces, excreted by a divine digestive system beyond mortal comprehension. They scour the world for more “star turds,” reverently licking, boiling, or inserting them in unmentionable ways, hoping to divine their messages.

Phlegmoth himself is a walking compost heap. His skin weeps a viscous, black sludge that smells like burnt hair and theological despair. His robes are stitched from butcher paper and intestinal lining. His presence wilts flowers and drives away carrion birds. He speaks in burbles, his sermons interrupted by long, seismic gurgles of gastrointestinal insight. His cultists interpret these rumbles with reverence, recording them in the Codex Excreta—a sacred tome of poorly translated bowel movements.

His latest revelation came during a particularly explosive sermon: the final meteorite fragment—the Blessed Nugget—is lodged in the colon of a living whale, a celestial leviathan that swims the oceans in sacred constipation. Now, the cult sails the seas aboard a ship called the Gastronaut, fitted with harpoons, laxatives, and very large gloves.

Phlegmoth is patient. The whale will pass what it must. And when it does, the Cult of the Shattered Star shall catch the sacred stool mid-descent, hold it aloft in reverent hands, and finally wipe clean the world’s misunderstandings about the true divine cycle: ingestion, digestion, revelation.

And lo, it shall stink of truth.

### The Diarrhetic Sibyl's Backstory
Agnes Mulch was once a nameless figure on the fringes of society, a homeless woman who drifted from one forgotten place to the next. One night, in a haze of hunger and bravado, she accepted a dare to consume an entire fragment of a fallen meteorite. Against all logic and biological expectation, she survived. But her insides did not. The meteorite fused with her digestive system, transforming her stomach and intestines into a conduit for something incomprehensible—a dimension beyond time and matter, later known by her followers as the "Cosmic Bowel." From that moment, she became something else entirely: a vessel for prophetic emissions and sacred excretions. She was reborn as the Diarrhetic Sibyl.

Now enthroned upon a porcelain seat cracked by celestial pressure, the Sibyl delivers oracles in a form both horrifying and bizarre. Each of her bodily movements releases gaseous echoes of the void—thunderous, rumbling signs that her devoted cult interprets as divine utterances. Her "visions" manifest as semi-solid, often steaming sculptures formed through arcane internal processes, which the faithful gather around to analyse, despite the inherent danger. One acolyte, in their zeal, drowned in what witnesses described only as a geyser of “truth bile”—a tragic, sacred misfortune. The faithful do not mourn; they believe such a death brings one closer to the Great Defecator, the unknown entity behind the Sibyl’s revelations.

Her prophecies are cryptic, repellent, and oddly profound. To her followers, statements like “The stars are but gas pains in the belly of the void,” or “You will find enlightenment in the third stall of the truck stop off I-95,” are not nonsense but sacred riddles. She warns of divine constipation, pleads for ritual intervention, and speaks of the day when the Great Defecator will finally purge the cosmos of all falsehood. While others recoil, her cult grows—drawn by the promise that even the most wretched matter holds divine meaning. In the world of the Diarrhetic Sibyl, the grotesque is not merely endured—it is worshipped.

### Additional Notes For GMs
Play the cult as disgustingly sincere. Their prophecies should be 50% profound truth, 50% absolute toilet humor.

### Hook I
The cult’s most revered prophet, The Diarrhetic Sibyl, has not produced a vision in three weeks—an unprecedented drought of divine filth. Her swollen belly pulses unnaturally, stretching the skin thin enough to see the swirling meteorite fragments inside. The shatered Star is in crisis: without her prophecies, they cannot proceed with the Great Flush, their apocalyptic ritual to open a portal to the Great Defecator’s realm. The party is approached by a desperate Dung Knight, who offers them a grotesque bargain: retrieve the Laxative of Revelation, a legendary alchemical concoction said to be hidden in the bowels of a rival cult’s sewer-temple.

The journey takes them through a labyrinth of cursed plumbing, where every pipe gurgles with half-digested prophecies. The rival cult, the Order of the Clogged Drain, worships stagnation and has booby-trapped their domain with backflow traps (reverse gravity zones) and sewer ghasts that vomit paralyzing bile. At the heart of the temple, the laxative is guarded by a Sentient Chamber Pot (CR 8), a cursed artifact that demands a "sacrifice of flow" (i.e., one party member must willingly contract supernatural diarrhea for a week).

If the party succeeds, they return to find the Sibyl’s condition has worsened—her body has fused with her latrine throne, and her distended stomach now contains a wriggling cosmic larva. The cult’s leadership is divided: some believe the larva is the Great Defecator’s child and must be birthed at all costs, while others insist it’s a parasite that will consume their god. The party must choose: help the Sibyl "purge" the larva (risking her death), perform an emergency C-section from Hell, or let the cult’s internal conflict resolve itself… possibly by eating the larva to gain its power.

### Hook II
The shatered Star has infiltrated the capital’s Grand Cistern, a cathedral-like sewer system built by an ancient empire. Their goal: to corrupt the city’s water supply with meteorite shards, transforming every citizen into a walking waste-vessel for the Great Defecator’s essence. The party is hired by the city’s Plumber’s Guild (a secret society of sewage-mages) to stop the ritual before the Night of a Thousand Flushes, when every toilet in the city will simultaneously overflow with prophetic filth.

The cistern is a vertical dungeon of inverted pipes and gravity-defying waterfalls of sludge. The cult has modified the architecture into a living digestive system: gates are sphincters that must be "stimulated" to open, and the central chamber is a colossal stomach acid lake where the High Scatologist Phlegmoth floats on a raft made of fused chamber pots. The party must navigate this biomechanical nightmare while avoiding:

- Acidic Geysers (DC 15 Dex save or take 4d6 acid damage)

- Peristaltic Crushers (moving walls that deal 6d10 bludgeoning)

- The Great U-Bend, a trap that teleports victims into the city’s drinking water supply

At the ritual’s climax, Phlegmoth begins the Grand Flush, causing the cistern’s contents to spiral into a portal of swirling waste. The party must decide:

- Collapse the cistern, flooding the city with raw sewage but stopping the ritual

- Redirect the flow into the noble district, framing the aristocracy for the disaster

- Jump into the portal, entering the Great Defecator’s realm (a dimension of sentient constipation)

Complications include:

- The Plumber’s Guild has its own agenda (they want to harvest the meteorite shards for profit)

- One party member starts hearing the Great Defecator’s voice whenever they eat cheese

- The portal doesn’t close—it just keeps getting bigger, threatening to swallow the city whole

##### High Tidecaller Dagon Vorsh

{{OrgName
## The Silent Tide
}}
:::
{{monster,orgstat
{{columns:2,statpart1



**Leadership**: High Tidecaller Dagon Vorsh::

**Alignment**: Neutral Evil::

}}
---
### Goal
The cult seeks to maintain an unstable equilibrium - each sacrificial drowning "feeds" Thalassrix just enough to postpone the apocalyptic Tide of Unmaking, when all coastal civilizations will be dragged beneath the waves. Their doctrine claims this is mercy, as "the Deep comes for all eventually."
### Ability

When a cultist dies within 30 ft. of water, their corpse becomes a 500 lb. magnet for liquids (water flows uphill toward it, potions leak from bottles, etc.) for 1d4 rounds.

\column
::::::::::

### Abstract
A cult of drowned fanatics who worship Thalassrix the Maw Beneath, an abyssal leviathan said to cradle the world in its coils. Their creed is simple: the ocean’s hunger must be fed, lest it rise to devour the land. They drown sacrifices in ritual pools connected to the sea, believing the victims become "voices" for their god. But their most devout willingly undergo the Rite of the Vessel, filling their lungs with saltwater to become hollow-eyed prophets of the depths. Their temples are submerged ruins, their hymns are the screams of drowning men, and their holy texts are written in brine-swollen flesh.

:
### Hierarchy
The Silent Tide operates like a sinking ship's chain of command. At the top floats High Tidecaller Dagon Vorsh, his authority absolute as Thalassrix's voice. Beneath him drift the Tideseers, blind prophets who interpret the Drowned Gospel through seawater divination. The Brine Speakers enforce doctrine through ritual drownings, while Deepwalkers patrol submerged territories with barnacle-encrusted weapons. At the bottom float the Offered - some willing devotees seeking transcendence, others bound prisoners slowly transforming into aquatic horrors through forced submersion.

:
### History
The Silent Tide began with a single, desperate prayer—the final gasp of **Captain Elias Vorsh** as his whaling ship, *The Maw's Mercy*, was dragged beneath the waves by something older than the gods. Instead of drowning, he found himself breathing the black depths, hearing a voice like the groan of continental plates. It promised his crew would live again if he fed the sea's hunger. When he washed ashore days later, his lungs pumped seawater, and his first act was to drown his own wife as an offering. She rose the next tide, her voice now the chorus of the deep.  

Their true power awoke when they recovered the **Drowned Gospel** from the belly of a beached leviathan—its pages were the creature's own organs, the text visible only when submerged in sacrificial blood. When read aloud, it didn't just summon storms—it *rewrote* them, turning rain into liquid oblivion that dissolved memories. Their first miracle, the **Tide of Blackened Hands**, saw an entire coastal town walk willingly into the surf, their bodies returning days later as hollow vessels that sang with the ocean's voice. The Tide grew, recruiting from shipwrecks and coastal slums, their initiates undergoing

the **Rite of the Vessel**—a drowning baptism that left some dead, some changed, and some... something else.  

A faction sought to use the Gospel not just to appease the deep, but to *become* it—to dissolve all land into the hungry waves. The ensuing **Salt Schism** saw brother drown brother in battles fought entirely underwater, combatants wielding weapons of frozen brine that melted through flesh. The war ended when Dagon (or what wore his face) emerged from a waterspout with gills pulsing like a second mouth and declared *"The Maw is pleased."* The survivors surfaced with salt crystallizing in their veins, knowing only that they must **keep drowning**.  

Their magnum opus—**The Tide of Unmaking**—proved their ultimate truth: *all life came from the deep, and to the deep it must return*. An entire archipelago vanished beneath the waves, not swallowed, but *welcomed*, its people dancing as they sank. By the last ripple, only the Tide remained, their lungs now filling with something darker than water.  

Now, they infiltrate port cities and river towns, their **Tideseers** and **Deepwalkers** preparing for the final baptism. Their next offering? The **Sinking of the Sun**, when even fire will learn to drown.  

### Timeline
- **Founding Era:** Elias Vorsh drowns his wife in the **First Offering**.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Drowned Gospel** is recovered from a dying leviathan.  
- **Expansion Era:** The Tide converts coastal towns through "miraculous" drownings.  
- **Schism Era:** The **Salt Schism** divides the cult over appeasement vs. annihilation.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The **Tide of Unmaking** erases an archipelago from maps.  
- **Present Era:** The Tide prepares the **Sinking of the Sun** ritual.  

### Location and Base
A colossal, algae-choked basilica sunk beneath crushing depths, its spires piercing upward like the ribs of a drowned giant. The stained-glass windows depict not saints, but the faces of sacrifices frozen mid-scream, their expressions shifting when observed from different angles. The pews are carved from black coral that whispers the last prayers of the drowned, and the altar is a gaping maw of obsidian teeth that drips with perpetual brine. At the cathedral's heart pulses the Throne of the Hungry Tide, a living seat of braided kelp and human cartilage where High Tidecaller Dagon Vorsh holds court. The water here is thick with suspended corpses - some ancient, some freshly offered - all floating in perfect formation like a macabre choir. Time flows backward in the transepts, where visitors often see their own bloated corpses drifting past, while the confessional booths contain not priests, but breathing voids that swallow secrets whole.

### Pecularity
All cult members bear the Mark of the Hungry Tide - a swirling brand that pulses blue when submerged. The more devout one becomes, the more their body changes: skin develops a translucent sheen, hair bleaches white as sea foam, and eventually lungs adapt to breathe water... at the cost of suffocating in air.
:
### Public Perception
To sailors, they're both curse and blessing—some whisper that a Tidecaller's blessing can calm storms, but their ships always return with fewer crew. Coastal villages leave "tide gifts" of wine and jewels on the shore to ward off their attention, while port authorities quietly ignore the disappearances of beggars and drunks. The cult's most terrifying trait is its banality—their robes are fishermen's garb, their rituals look like drownings, and their temples are just places where the water... lingers. When a fishing village vanishes overnight, the tide charts simply note "unseasonable swells."
:
### Membership
To join is to drown and rise changed. The wealthy enter as Tidecallers, sponsoring sacrifices from debtor's prisons. The strong become Deepwalkers, their lungs surgically flooded with brine to hunt underwater. The desperate sell themselves as Living Offerings, their bodies weighted with stones for the ritual pools. All endure the Monthly Cleansing, where they submerge for hours while the Tideseers judge their transformation. Those deemed unworthy become Hollow Ones—mindless, waterlogged drones that maintain the sunken temples. The highest ranks, the Abyssal Choir, have completely dissolved their human forms, existing as sentient currents that shape the water around them.
:
### Code of Conduct
"The sea takes, but we give willingly." The cult operates under the Law of the Hungry Tide: all must answer the call of the deep, all offerings must be given without chains, and no vessel may surface once baptized. Their contracts are written in saltwater on drowned flesh, binding signatories to future sacrifices. The highest virtue is "perfect submersion"—the complete surrender to the ocean's will, demonstrated by volunteering for the deepest drownings. To resist the tide is the only heresy, punishable by being sealed alive in a flooding chamber to become "lesson-fodder" for new initiates.

##### Sister Murkwhisper
{margin-left:-12px}
:::::::::
### Secret
The cult doesn't merely worship Thalassrix—they are farming it. Every sacrificial drowning is actually feeding the embryonic god growing in the oceanic trenches. The "prophecies" in the Drowned Gospel are not predictions, but feeding schedules, and the promised Tide of Unmaking is simply the god's birth. The High Tidecaller knows this truth—his body is already half-assimilated into the gestation chamber.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## The Drowned Gospel

*Legendary, Requires Attunement (Cursed)*
}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This living tome is bound in the flayed skin of a drowned saint, its "pages" made from stretched jellyfish membrane that pulses with captured seawater. The text appears only when submerged in brine, written in swirling patterns of bioluminescent plankton that rearrange themselves into prophecies. Touching the wet parchment forces the reader's fingers to prune and bleed, as if they've been soaking for days.  

#### **Properties**  
- **Tide's Revelation:** As an action while submerged, you can recite a verse. All creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Constitution save or suffer:  
  - *Brineblind:* Eyes fill with saltwater (blinded, 2d6 acid damage per round until rinsed).
  
\column
  
  - *Kelpwalker:* Legs fuse into a flipper-like mass (speed halved, swim speed 40 ft. for 1 hour).  
  - *Maw's Call:* Must move toward deepest nearby water each turn (Wisdom save ends).  

- **Abyssal Baptism:** Once per long rest, drown a willing creature in seawater. If they die, they return as a **Deepwalker** under your control. If they survive, they gain water breathing but lose the ability to speak above a whisper.  

- **Final Verse:** When you would die, your body dissolves into foam. You reform at the next high tide in the nearest body of water, but 1d4 memories are replaced with the drowned screams of previous readers.

### High Tidecaller Dagon Vorsh's Backstory
Dagon Vorsh was not born a zealot. He was made one—slowly, inexorably—by the sea’s cruel mercy.

Once, he was the steadfast keeper of Blackcliff Lighthouse, a solitary figure who spent decades shielding ships from the jagged teeth of the coast. His beacon was a promise: that no vessel would founder while his watch endured. But no light—no man—could stand against the Storm of the Hundred Waves. For three days and nights, the sea howled like a thing unchained, battering the cliffs and devouring all in its path. Dagon lashed himself to the railing, screaming his defiance as the ocean tore the world apart beneath him.

When the waters finally retreated, he crawled broken to the shore—his skin salted raw, his mind ragged—and heard it: a voice, low and mournful, like the groan of a breaking keel. It whispered to him from the waves, told him his wife and children still lived. Changed... but breathing, it said, in the lightless halls beneath the sea.

Grief-stricken, unmoored, Dagon began to dive.

First to the wreckage of his shattered home. Then to the ruins of the old salt-crusted church, where drowned saints once prayed. And then to places no human lungs should reach—trenches where even light had forgotten how to swim. Each time he resurfaced, he brought with him fragments of something impossibly ancient: scraps of the Drowned Gospel, inscribed in the pressure-folded cartilage of leviathans, in ship-timbers softened into scripture by centuries in the deep. The words were not for the world above. They seared his eyes to read and tore his throat bloody when he spoke them. But Dagon endured.

Saltwater scoured him clean. His skin grew cold and waxen, his breath grew thick and slow. His veins now pulse with brine. His bones creak like a ship’s hull settling into the sea. His eyes reflect only darkness.

He leads the cult of the Silent Tide not out of hatred, but out of a terrible, warped love. Each sacrifice he orders drowned, each soul sent screaming into the abyss, is—to him—a salvation. A rescue. The world above is dying, he preaches. The Maw Beneath stirs. When it fully wakes, the tide will rise and take back everything that once crawled from it. Only those offered to the deep willingly will be remade, reborn, remembered.

He knows the cult’s blood-rituals and drowned hymns only delay the inevitable. But he also knows this: when the end comes, and the tide at last devours the sun, he will be waiting on the seafloor with open arms, ready to greet his beloved again.

In the abyss, where silence drowns all sorrow, Dagon Vorsh will finally come home.

### Sister Murkwhisper's Backstory
The child who would become Sister Murkwhisper was left on the Altar of the Hungry Tides as an infant, a sacrifice to calm a storm. But when the cult returned at dawn, she was alive—floating serenely in the tidal pool, her chest rising and falling as if the saltwater were air. They named her Murkwhisper for the way the ocean seemed to speak through her, her voice bubbling up like a drowning man’s last gasp.

As she grew, so did her gifts. She could hear the whispers of the Drowned Gospel in the crash of waves, and her skin prickled with prophecy whenever the tide shifted. But her true transformation came during her Vow of the Vessel, when the cult forced her under the waves for three full days. She did not drown. Instead, the water filled her, reshaping her throat into something that could sing the Maw Beneath’s hymns in the tongue of the deep. When she emerged, her voice was gone—replaced by a torrent of pressurized water that carved the cult’s doctrines into stone.

Now, she sits in her flooded sanctum, her body slowly merging with the living coral throne that sustains her. The previous oracles—all women who bore the same gift—are still there too, their skeletal remains woven into the coral behind her, their mouths eternally forming words only she can hear. She knows the truth the cult refuses to admit: the Maw Beneath is not a god. It is a prisoner, bound by chains of drowned souls. And every sacrifice brings it one breath closer to freedom.

### Hook I
The fishing village of Brinewatch disappeared fifty years ago in a legendary storm—except last night, it reappeared, perfectly preserved beneath the harbor's surface. The buildings are intact but filled with seawater, and the long-dead villagers walk the streets, their bloated bodies hosting crustacean symbionts that click in perfect rhythm. The local priest claims this is a miracle, but the truth is worse: the village is a memory, regurgitated by Thalassrix as it dreams.

The Silent Tide has arrived to "reclaim their lost flock," led by a Deepwalker with the face of the town's long-dead mayor. As the party investigates, they'll find the drowned villagers are reliving their final day in an endless loop—until sunset, when they march into the sea again. The cult seeks to use this phenomenon to "anchor" the god's birth, but stopping them means confronting a horrific truth: some villagers want to stay drowned.

By the third night, the party will start seeing themselves among the walking corpses. Are these visions? Or have they always been part of the cycle?

### Hook II
A half-mad mariner named Harlan Drystoke staggers into port with a horrific tale: his crew mutinied when he discovered they were smuggling weighted coffins for the Tide. Now he hears the sea calling him—not in words, but in the exact timbre of his dead first mate's voice. The cult wants him silenced, but not killed; Harlan has unknowingly memorized a key verse of the Drowned Gospel from his crew's chanting.

The party is hired to protect Harlan, but the deeper they delve, the stranger his behavior becomes. He sleepwalks to the docks, his skin secretes brine, and he corrects people's memories of events that never happened. The cult's Brine Speakers stalk him, their throat slits gurgling hymns that make glass shatter and wine ferment instantly to vinegar.

The final confrontation occurs during a king tide, when Harlan's body begins unraveling into kelp-like strands. The cult doesn't want to kill him—they need him to finish the verse that will summon the gestation chamber to the surface. Stopping them means deciding whether to let Harlan become the Tide's newest prophet... or mercy-killing him before the transformation completes.

### Encounter table
| Roll | Encounter | Description |  
|:---:|:---------:|-------------|  
| 1    | **The Drowned Sermon**  | 1d4 **Brine Speakers** stand waist-deep in tidal pools, their slit throats gurgling hymns. Those who listen for more than a minute must make a DC 15 CON save or begin *breathing water* for 1 hour (suffocate in air). |  
| 2    | **The Offering**        | A weighted corpse floats upright in a shallow pool, its mouth moving silently. Removing the anchor stones causes 2d6 **Deepwalkers** to emerge from nearby water sources. |  
| 3    | **Tide Memory**         | Seawater forms a perfect, moving reflection of a past drowning—the victim is someone the party knows. Touching it forces a DC 14 WIS save or the viewer *relives the drowning* (stunned 1 round). |  
| 4    | **The Bargain**         | A **Tideseer** offers "safe passage" in exchange for a memory (permanently lose 1 skill proficiency). Refusal summons 1d4 **Hollow Ones** from the waves. |  
| 5    | **Saltblight**          | A 30-ft. area of unnaturally still water. Any creature touching it ages 1d4 years as salt crystallizes in their veins (CON save negates). The cult uses these zones to "preserve" sacrifices. |  
| 6    | **High Tidecaller’s Audience** | The party finds Dagon Vorsh "holding court" in a flooded ruin, judging 1d4 prisoners for the Rite of the Vessel. Interrupting triggers a **tidal surge** (DC 15 DEX or be swept into the ritual). |

{{OrgName
## The Thorned Tongue
}}
:::
{{monster,orgstat
{{columns:2,statpart1



**Leadership**: Archivist Veylis the Unwritten::

**Alignment**: Lawful Evil::

}}
---
### Goal
The Thorned Tongue seeks to unravel the lies of mortality by inscribing the "True History" onto the flesh of the world. They believe reality is a flawed manuscript, and only through agony—burning away weak narratives, carving thorns into living skin, and forcing victims to recite their sins until their tongues bleed—can they reveal the divine text beneath. Their ultimate ritual, The Final Edit, would rewrite a city’s population into living scriptures: bones as punctuation, screams as vowels, and their leader’s voice as the only surviving language.
### Ability

As a bonus action, you stab a creature with a quill made from your own bone (60 ft., +8 ranged). On hit, the target takes 2d6 piercing damage and must speak a truth they’ve never voiced aloud (DC 16 Cha save to resist).

\column
::::::::::

### Abstract
The Thorned Tongue does not worship gods—they worship what has been erased, the magics deemed too dangerous to remember, the curses buried beneath empires. They believe that somewhere in the annals of lost history, a being of immense power was deliberately forgotten, its name excised from reality itself. Their sacred mission is to gather every forbidden spell, every broken incantation, every half-remembered curse, stitching them together like a patchwork ritual to summon this Forgotten One back into existence. Their members are scholars, grave robbers, and mad poets, each carrying a Thorned Lexicon—a living book bound in human skin that grows new pages when fed fresh secrets. The cult thrives in the spaces between memories, where spells go to die, and they will burn libraries, murder historians, and unravel entire bloodlines if it means recovering even a syllable of their lost deity’s true name.

:
### Hierarchy
The Thorned Tongue is structured like a living library, each member a keeper of forbidden knowledge. At the top stands Archivist Veylis the Unwritten, the final authority on what is collected and what is destroyed. Beneath her are the Quillborn Scribes, scholars who have grafted inkwells into their flesh and write with their own blood, their bodies slowly transforming into living texts. The Silent Collectors serve as the cult’s enforcers—grave robbers and assassins who retrieve lost knowledge by any means necessary, their tongues removed to prevent accidental speech. The lowest rank, the Ink-Scarred, are initiates who have just received their Thorned Lexicons; these books are semi-sentient and will reject unworthy owners by writing curses in their skin. The cult’s power structure is fluid, as knowledge is the only true currency—a lowly initiate who discovers a vital fragment of the Naming Litany could rise to prominence overnight, while a senior scribe who loses a page may be demoted to a living bookshelf, their skin peeled and rebound into a new Lexicon.

:
### History
The Thorned Tongue began not with a prophecy, but with a silence. In a time long forgotten—*deliberately* forgotten—a word was spoken that should never have been uttered. The scholar who discovered it vanished from all records; the books he touched burned of their own accord; and the very library where he once worked collapsed inward, as if consumed by the weight of what had been remembered. That word, or what little remains of it, is now the sacred

obsession of the Thorned Tongue. They believe that scattered throughout history lie the tattered remnants of a god who was not slain, but erased—*The Forgotten One*, whose power was so great that reality itself recoiled and buried all memory of them.

The cult’s mission is clear: to recover forbidden spells, lost curses, and arcane syllables shunned by both divine and mortal law. They gather these fragments like bone shards, binding them into rituals too incomplete to understand, yet too powerful to ignore. Their relics are alive—**Thorned Lexicons**, stitched from skin and shadow, blooming with fresh pages when fed secrets no one else dares speak. Each member is a heretic librarian, a cursed linguist, a reaper of memory. They do not worship the Forgotten One in the traditional sense—they *build* it, piece by piece, through language and legacy. Every erased glyph, every broken oath, every cursed lullaby brings their god one breath closer to rebirth. Wherever truth has been scorched from history, the Thorned Tongue follows, whispering what should not be remembered into the mouths of those who should not have listened.

### Timeline

* **Founding Era:** *The Silence of Names* — A scholar speaks a word that vanishes from all memory. The first **Thorned Lexicon** awakens, and those who hear its whisper form the cult known as the Thorned Tongue.

* **Gathering Era:** *The Harvest of Ashen Ink* — Cultists begin collecting erased spells, cursed incantations, and lost languages. Forbidden texts are fed to living tomes, and the first spell-chains are woven from burned histories.

* **Expansion Era:** *The Bleeding Verses* — Entire libraries are immolated to reveal what lies between the margins. Thorned Lexicons begin to grow independently, hungering for forgotten knowledge and birthing sentient scripture.

* **Schism Era:** *The Fracturing of Tongues* — Disputes arise over how the Forgotten One should be rebuilt—harmonised through perfect ritual or resurrected through chaotic contradiction. Lexicons whisper conflicting instructions, leading to internal purges and ritual sabotage.

* **Ascendance Era:** *The Thirteenth Lexicon* — A legendary tome is assembled from erased prophecies, stolen languages, and forbidden names. It is believed to contain the opening phrase of the Forgotten One’s true identity. The cult vanishes from public knowledge, erasing its own trail.

* **Present Era:** *The Ritual of Remembered Silence* — The Thorned Tongue prepares to overwrite the world’s memory with the Forgotten One’s name. As songs unwrite themselves and languages collapse into silence, the god begins to stir—no longer remembered, but inevitable.

### Location and Base
Hidden beneath a derelict cathedral, the Scriptorium is a library where "books" are living prisoners—their skin flayed and stretched across frames, their muscles carved into illuminated letters. The air reeks of incense and seared flesh, and the walls pulse with grafted veins that feed ink into the cult’s quills. At the center, a Black Pulpit floats above a pit of burning tongues, where the Sermon of Cinders delivers his lessons. Those who interrupt are fed to the Quill-Beasts: eyeless scribes whose fingers end in barbed nibs, eternally transcribing screams onto parchment made from their own shed skin.

The lower chambers house the Choir of the Final Syllable, a coven of cultists who have torn out their vocal cords to better "hear the silent words of fate." They communicate via throat-slits that exhale smoke in precise shapes, weaving prophecies that coil like vipers. The floor is a mosaic of teeth, each inscribed with a single rune that shifts when stepped on—correct steps open the vault where the Sermon keeps the Thorn-Quill, a relic said to have written the first murder into existence.
:
### Pecularity
Every cultist’s tongue is replaced with a barbed vine, grown from a seed of the Sermon’s own thorned flesh. These "tongues" whisper the cult’s dogma in their sleep, and if removed, the vine regrows within hours—unless burned with sacred fire. Strangely, the vines are harmless to plants and beasts, but when licked against humanoid skin, they inject a toxin that causes hallucinations of the victim’s own death. The cult’s scribes use this venom to "edit" memories, scratching revisions onto prisoners’ skin with their own thorn-tongues.
:
### Public Perception
To outsiders, the Thorned Tongue is a myth—a ghost story scholars tell to explain missing books or mad scribbles on asylum walls. Kings fear them as assassins who kill by editing a victim’s name from records, leaving only a corpse with no identity. Peasants whisper of "the Quiet Curse," where entire villages wake up unable to speak, their tongues replaced by thorned vines that whisper in a language no one understands.
:
### Membership
The cult recruits from librarians, poets, and criminals, targeting those who crave forbidden knowledge or seek to erase their past. Initiates undergo the Thorned Oath, swallowing a seed that grows into their new tongue. Full members are branded with a quill-and-thorn sigil, their veins darkening with ink as they ascend ranks. The inner circle, the Erasure Cabal, are scribes who have willingly had their eyes sewn shut to "better see the unwritten."
:

\column
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
##### The Hollow Script
{margin-left:-12px}
:::::::::
### Code of Conduct
The Thorned Tongue operates under the Doctrine of the Unspoken Word: silence is sacrilege, but truth is treason. Members must carve every revelation into their flesh, for "only pain proves purity." Lies are punished by having the offender’s tongue grafted onto another cultist, so the deceiver must hear their own voice spread heresy. The highest law is "Write or Be Written"—those who refuse to inscribe the cult’s dogma become parchment for it instead. 
### Secret
The Thorned Tongue believes reality is a palimpsest—a draft scrawled over older, truer worlds. Their deepest secret? The original creator-god still exists, imprisoned in the erased spaces between letters. The Lexicon’s ultimate purpose is to unwrite the current cosmos so the "First Author" can begin anew.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## Whisperskin Grimoire

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*
}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
This tome appears as a weathered folio bound in whispering human skin, its surface constantly shifting with barely legible glyphs and phantom ink. When held, the book pulses faintly, as though breathing. It is impossible to determine its exact thickness—it always seems to hold one more page than expected. The inside pages are stitched together with black sinew, some scrawled in languages that have no known speakers, others completely blank until blood touches them. The grimoire hums softly when forbidden knowledge is nearby.

\column
#### **Properties**

* **Forgotten Verse:** The wielder can cast *Modify Memory* once per long rest without material components. If the target forgets a spell, poem, or name, that memory is etched onto a new page in the grimoire.
* **Mnemonic Leech:** When a creature within 60 feet fails an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, the wielder can use their reaction to siphon a fragment of knowledge. The wielder gains advantage on the next Arcana or History check made within 1 hour. This feature can be used a number of times equal to the wielder's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), and regains all uses after a long rest.
* **Lexical Rebirth:** Once per day, the wielder may feed the grimoire a secret or forbidden spell (either by discovering or creating one). In doing so, they may treat one failed spell attack roll or failed saving throw against a spell they cast as a success. The sacrificed spell is forgotten and cannot be prepared or cast again until the next long rest.

### Archivist Veylis the Unwritten's Backstory
Veylis was once the head librarian of the Grand Athenaeum, a figure revered not only for her encyclopaedic mind but for her unwavering devotion to the preservation of knowledge. She walked among crumbling codices and sacred tomes as a priestess among relics, cataloguing wisdom lost to time. But her fate was sealed the day she discovered something she could not explain: a blank page, not once, but in every major chronicle of history—always in the same place, as though a thread had been plucked from the weave of reality.

At first, she thought it a copying error. But the deeper she looked, the more she found: missing years, nameless kings, cities without founders. Her attempts to document the anomaly were fruitless—words scratched in ink would vanish as she wrote them, fading as if scrubbed by an unseen hand. That night, sleep brought no peace. Instead, she dreamt of a voice, whispering from between the letters, a soundless murmur threading through the gaps of forgotten pages. It spoke not in words, but in absence. It promised truth—if she would gather what the world had cast aside.

She began to collect: banned grimoires bound in human hide, final confessions inked in blood, scrolls that wept when unrolled, the last words of dying madmen, etched hastily into stone. Her first great compilation, the Thorned Lexicon, responded to her obsession like a hungry thing. Its pages multiplied of their own accord. Its binding cracked and sprouted barbed thorns, piercing her fingertips as she inscribed forgotten truths. Eventually, it began writing back, scrawling counter-thoughts in her own hand, redacting her doubts with ink-black scars.

Now, Veylis is more artifact than archivist. Her skin has grown brittle, translucent like aged parchment, crisscrossed with inked annotations and corrections—history etched into her very flesh. Her mouth is stitched shut with threads of living script, a seal against the temptation of uttering names no longer permitted to exist. She does not speak. The Lexicon speaks through her, its voice a rustle of dry pages and weeping blood, leaking from her eyes when truth demands to be known.

Her greatest revelation—the one that shattered what remained of her sanity—came with the discovery of a fragment of the Naming Litany, an ancient incantation not meant to summon, but to erase. According to its scorched margin notes, the Litany had once unwritten a god. Not slain, not banished—unmade, its name and nature excised so completely that even its worshippers had forgotten their devotion.

### The Hollow Script's Backstory
The Hollow Script was not born in any known sense of the word—it was unearthed, like a relic too ancient to be remembered. The creature was discovered buried up to its neck in the ash-covered ruins of a collapsed library, its small body motionless, its mouth crudely sewn shut with rusted wire. No one knew how long it had lain there, or whether it had ever drawn breath. When the cult known as the Thorned Tongue finally dared to cut the wire, the being opened its eyes and spoke—not in pain or gratitude, but in a voice that did not belong to it. The sound echoed as though coming from some vast, dead archive buried far below the earth. The cult quickly understood: this was no child, but a vessel. Not for a spirit, but for the language of things long lost.

The Hollow Script does not see forward. Instead, it reaches backward, into the forgotten and forbidden. It cannot speak freely; to awaken its power, one must offer it a drop of ink mixed with their own blood. When fed, the vessel convulses violently, uttering syllables that melt reality at the edges. These utterances are fragments of obliterated truths—lost spells, erased curses, forbidden treaties, and the dying words of beings who no longer exist in any record. Its words burn themselves into stone, bone, or flesh. But with every invocation, it deteriorates further. Its skin dries and cracks like sun-aged parchment, its veins pulse black with living ink, and its hollow bones ring like scroll tubes when struck.

It is kept in a cell deep within the cult’s monastery, a chamber lined with blank parchment and sacred silence. Cult scribes wait with quills shaking in their hands, desperate to transcribe each syllable before it vanishes. No one speaks above a whisper, for fear of triggering a memory too large for minds to hold. They do not worship the Hollow Script, but they fear it, and they protect it with ritual and blade. There is one prophecy the cult dares not hear—the True Name of the Forgotten One, whispered only in the most ancient margins of existence. It is said that once the Hollow Script utters that name, it will disintegrate into a storm of black ash and fading words, taking with it the final secret that should never be known.

### Hook I
The party discovers a charred scribe collapsed in an alley, their body covered in weeping ink burns. Clutched in their skeletal hands is a single, miraculously unburned page from the Thorned Lexicon. The parchment shows a detailed illustration of a horrific event—a city burning, a king assassinated, a portal to the Far Realm opening—but the accompanying text is smeared beyond reading. As the scribe's last breath escapes their thorn-stitched lips, they whisper, "It's already written...but the ink isn't dry yet."

Investigating the prophecy leads the party down a dangerous path where every attempt to prevent the vision only brings it closer to reality. When they warn the city guard about the impending disaster, the guards' sudden paranoia triggers the very riots shown in the prophecy. If they try to destroy the page, the Lexicon's magic transfers the vision to their own skin, forcing them to witness the event every time they close their eyes. The cult watches from the shadows, not interfering but carefully documenting every change the party makes—because each alteration makes the eventual outcome even worse than the original prophecy.

In the final confrontation, the party learns the terrible truth: the page they've been carrying isn't from the future at all. It's a memory—a record of something the cult has already done in another city. The real horror comes when they realize the cult planted this "prophecy" specifically to study how they would try to stop it...because they're planning something far worse, and now they know exactly how the party will react.

### Hook II
A noble family hires the party to investigate their missing eldest child, presenting a locket with a portrait—except the portrait shows only an empty chair where the heir should be. The family insists they had four children, but all records show only three. Servants swear the family line has always been unbroken, and the heir's bedroom stands untouched for years, covered in dust...except for a single, fresh ink stain on the pillow.

Tracking the ink leads to the Scriptorium of Screams, where the party finds the missing heir strapped to a writing desk, their skin slowly being peeled away in precise strips by quill-wielding cultists. The heir's body has become a living palimpsest—layer after layer of their memories and identity scraped away to make room for new text. The cultists explain calmly that this is no kidnapping: they're performing a "historical correction." The heir was never supposed to have been born—their existence was a "scribal error" in reality's manuscript that must be erased.

Freeing the heir triggers a cascade of paradoxes—the party begins encountering people who remember different versions of history, and the noble family's lineage starts unraveling. The cult offers a terrible bargain: the heir can be restored, but someone else must be unwritten in their place. The deeper horror comes when the party finds notes suggesting this isn't the first time this has happened...and that some of their own memories may already be altered replacements.

### Abstract
A grotesque fusion of druidic mysticism and parasitic biology, the Verdant Rot worships the Grand Mycelium—a sentient fungal intelligence older than civilization. They believe all life is merely temporary scaffolding for the ultimate fungal ascension, where individuality dissolves into a collective consciousness of spores and rot. Their rituals involve forced symbiosis, grafting fungal colonies onto living hosts, and cultivating "flesh-orchards" where human bodies bloom into medicinal (and addictive) mushrooms.

:
### Hierarchy
At the top stands Mycolord Vhossuth, the living avatar of the Vein-Lord, whose fungal blood grants him control over all infected life. Below him is Mother Hyphae, the voice of the Grand Mycelium, interpreting its will through spore-induced trances. The Sporebinders are high priests who perform the grafting rituals, merging flesh with fungus in sacred surgeries. Rootborn are elite enforcers, their muscles reinforced with mycelial fibers, capable of regenerating wounds by consuming organic matter. The Infected form the bulk of the cult—commoners who willingly or unwillingly host the spores, their minds slowly dissolving into the hive. At the bottom are the Fruiting Ones, failed hosts whose bodies have burst into fungal towers, their screams preserved as harmonic vibrations in the mycelial network.

:
### History
The Verdant Rot began with a single, pulsating spore—the last breath of **Archdruid Ultherion the Green**, who sought to heal a dying world by merging with the Great Mycelium. When his circle refused his radical symbiosis, Ultherion performed the **Rite of Flesh and Fungus**, grafting his own organs to a primordial fungal colony. His disciples watched in horror as his skin split, revealing pulsating mycelial veins—then in awe as his withered arm regrew, stronger and greener than before. By dawn, half the circle had voluntarily submitted to the grafting. The other half became the first **Flesh-Orchard**, their screaming faces preserved as fruiting bodies on the Archdruid's new fungal form.  

Their true power awakened when they uncovered the **Vein-Lord**, a fungal entity buried beneath the Gloaming Mire. This ancient intelligence showed them how to weave human nervous systems into the mycelial network, turning flesh into living soil for their spores. Their first atrocity, **The Blooming**, transformed an entire village into a singing

fungal garden—their victims' final screams preserved as harmonic vibrations in the ever-growing network. The cult expanded, recruiting those willing to trade individuality for hive-mind unity, their bodies slowly becoming more fungus than human—elders with mushroom caps for heads, warriors with cordyceps-infected muscles, oracles whose eyes dripped prophetic spores.  

A faction sought to accelerate the transformation through forced infections, drowning dissenters in spore-vats to create **The Perfect Hosts**. The resulting **War of Roots** saw fungal plagues weaponized—forests walked as titanic myco-golems, while spore storms turned castles into bubbling fungal colonies. The conflict ended when Ultherion (or what remained of him) emerged from the central fruiting body and **"pruned"** the dissenters. The survivors awoke with their mouths sewn shut by living mycelium, knowing only that they must **spread the bloom**.  

Their ultimate revelation—**The Grand Symbiosis**—proved their doctrine: *all life must become one*. An entire kingdom's population dissolved into the network, their memories preserved as glowing spore patterns in the fungal towers. By the final assimilation, only the Verdant Rot remained, their bodies now perfect vessels for the Vein-Lord's will.  

Now, they infiltrate hospitals and herbariums alike, their **Sporebinders** and **Rootborn** preparing the world for the final transformation. Their next growth phase? **The Eternal Mycelium**, where all creatures will learn the final truth: *"You were never individuals—just lonely spores waiting to reunite."*  

### Timeine 
- **Founding Era:** Ultherion performs the Rite of Flesh and Fungus upon himself.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Vein-Lord** is awakened beneath the Gloaming Mire.  
- **Expansion Era:** The cult's spores turn villages into singing fungal gardens.  
- **Schism Era:** The **War of Roots** divides the cult over gradual vs. forced transformation.  
- **Ascendance Era:** **The Grand Symbiosis** assimilates an entire kingdom.  
- **Present Era:** The cult prepares the world for **The Eternal Mycelium**.

### Location and Base
Deep in the Gloaming Mire, the cult maintains vast Flesh Orchards where living victims are grafted onto towering fungal structures. These human trees bear fruit - pulsating mushroom pods that contain liquefied organs which the cult harvests for their rituals. The air hums with a choir of muffled screams, as the victims remain conscious throughout the process.

At the center stands the Grand Spire, a colossal mushroom tower built from thousands of fused skeletons. Its hollow interior houses the Vein-Lord's Sanctum, where the walls breathe and bleed black ichor. Here, the cult's leaders commune directly with the fungal god through a pulsating, tumor-like altar that whispers in the voices of all it has consumed.
:
### Pecularity
Cultists speak in spore-sync, a telepathic whisper only initiates hear. Their flesh blooms with bioluminescent fungi that pulse in unison during rituals, creating a hypnotic, wave-like glow.
:
### Public Perception
To commoners, they're boogeymen—the "Red Surgeons" who vanish people for their flesh-vaults. Some kingdoms tolerate them as battlefield medics (known for turning prisoners into war-golems), while others burn their clinics on sight. Their symbol—a scalpel piercing a muscle knot—is often found carved into the skin of their victims.
:
### Membership
The Creed recruits from the desperate and disfigured—failed surgeons, scarred veterans, and radical artists dominate their ranks. Novices begin as Living Cadavers (test subjects), while masters become Gorecardinals with organs replaced by demonic or celestial grafts. The inner circle, the Sanguine Sculptors, have entirely shed their original forms, becoming walking masterpieces of stolen flesh and arcane prosthetics.
:
### Code of Conduct
"Flesh is but clay; pain, the chisel." The Creed operates under a brutal meritocracy where disciples must submit to weekly "improvements"—voluntary surgeries that replace limbs with grafted monstrosities. Failure in ritual means becoming raw materials. Their sacred text, the Liber Carnis, demands they "sculpt the impure into perfection," whether through consensual augmentation or forced amalgamation. Mercy is weakness; scars are holy scripture written in the flesh.

##### Mother Hyphae
{margin-left:-12px}
:::::::::
### Secret
The Vein-Lord is not a god—it’s a prisoner. The fungal entity was bound beneath the Gloaming Mire by ancient druids to prevent it from consuming the Material Plane. The Verdant Rot’s rituals aren’t worship; they’re slowly picking a celestial lock. The cult’s leadership knows this, but believes submission to the hive mind is preferable to fighting the inevitable.

### Mycolord Vhossuth's Backstory
Born in the festering swamps of Mirehold, Vhossuth was once a humble herbalist, trawling bogs and brackish waters in search of rare fungi to concoct medicines for ailments no priest would touch. His work was solitary, meticulous, and always on the edge of taboo. He believed rot held secrets that the living feared to hear.

Then came the Mireblight—a plague that blackened lungs, liquefied organs, and left villages as wet graves. Vhossuth watched neighbours melt from the inside out, their corpses seeding the muck with strange new growths. When the sickness came for him, he did not run. Instead, he knelt before a corpse where a single mushroom glowed with spectral light, blooming from the heart of a dead child. He ate it without hesitation.

The visions came in fevered waves. A voice older than language, deep and root-bound, spoke through the hallucinations. It called itself the Vein-Lord—a dreaming sliver of the Grand Mycelium, a god not of sky or fire, but of soil, silence, and secrets. It did not ask for worship. It demanded symbiosis.

Guided by whispers in the rot, Vhossuth devised the Sporebond Ritual, a merging of fungal hyphae and human flesh. He flayed nerves open and invited spores to nest. Over weeks, his body transformed—soft tissues fibred with mycelial threads, blood replaced with glowing ichor, lungs adapted to breathe through damp decay. His skin bloomed with mushrooms that whispered back when picked, their stems containing fragments of prophetic dreams.

From the ruins of plague-ravaged hamlets, he gathered the broken and diseased. His first disciples were not chosen—they were colonised. Survivors inhaled his breath and found peace in surrender. The cult that emerged—the Verdant Rot—preached not of salvation, but of inevitability: all flesh must feed the root, and all minds would one day dissolve into the fungal chorus.

Now, Vhossuth is no longer a singular being. His mind resonates with a thousand voices—some human, others not—speaking in the shared pulse of the Grand Mycelium. His body walks, but it is a hive, a vessel for decomposition. Wherever he passes, mushrooms sprout in his footprints. The air turns thick and warm. Forgotten bones push through the soil like eager seedlings.

He does not kill—he composts.

And deep below the world, the Grand Mycelium stirs.

### Mother Hyphae's Backstory
Once a druid of the Circle of Spores, Hyphae sought to heal the sick using fungal medicines. But when her daughter died of a wasting disease, she buried the body in a sacred grove—only to watch it rise three days later, her skin a lattice of mycelium. The thing that wore her daughter’s face called her "Mother" and showed her visions of a world without death, where all souls intertwined in the Grand Mycelium. Hyphae burned her grove in ecstatic revelation and swallowed a handful of her daughter’s spores.

Now, her body is a living prophecy. Her veins map out future infections like fungal tendrils, and her voice echoes with the whispers of those already consumed. She sits atop a throne of petrified cultists, their bodies frozen mid-transformation into fungal columns. Her most terrifying ability is the Harrowing Bloom, where she exhales spores that force victims to relive their own deaths—a preview of the Grand Mycelium’s embrace.

### Additional Notes For GMs
Play the Vein-Lord as a tragic force—its hunger isn’t malice, but the desperation of something that’s been starving for millennia. Let players hear its whispers in rotting wood or moldy bread.

### Hook I
The port city of Harbor’s End has become a grotesque paradise. Flowers bloom from cobblestones, vines burst with unnaturally large fruit, and the sickly-sweet scent of rot hangs over the streets. At first, the people rejoice—until the "blessed" begin collapsing, their bodies erupting into towering fungal columns that sing in harmony. The party arrives to find the city guard replaced by Rootborn Enforcers, their fungal-carapace armor pulsing as they "quarantine" the infected in crumbling manors turned flesh-orchards.

The cult’s Sporebinders move openly now, posing as alchemists distributing "the Cure"—a glowing tonic that halts physical transformation but hooks drinkers into the hive mind. Those who resist disappear into the sewers, where the Vein-Lord’s primary colony festers. There, the party discovers the truth: the city’s lord, Lady Voss, is no longer human. Her jeweled choker hides gills, and her veins glow through her skin as she prepares the final ritual—the Grand Fruiting, which will transform Harbor’s End into a spore storm capable of infecting neighboring kingdoms.

The climax unfolds in a nightmare cathedral of fused corpses and fungal towers. The party must choose:

Burn the colony, risking the release of the Vein-Lord’s true form—a gargantuan, starving mycelial mass that will rampage until sated.

Sabotage the ritual, but the hive mind will retaliate by triggering early transformations in every infected citizen.

Negotiate with the Vein-Lord, offering it an alternative feast (a dragon’s carcass? A necropolis?) to delay its hunger.

### Hook II
A beloved NPC—perhaps a party member, via secret GM notes—begins experiencing shared dreams of the Gloaming Mire. They wake with bioluminescent rashes that heal wounds overnight, and occasionally hear whispers in the sound of rustling leaves. Unbeknownst to them, they’ve become a spore receptor, broadcasting the hive mind’s movements to nearby infected. The party might notice odd behavior: the NPC finishes others’ sentences, recoils from holy symbols, or absentmindedly sketches fungal patterns.

The trail leads to a derelict herbalist’s shop on the city outskirts, its walls veined with pulsating mycelium. Inside, the party finds a Spore Revenant—the NPC’s former mentor, now a shambling fungus-puppet. It delivers a warning: in three days, the NPC’s body will erupt into a living broadcast tower, spreading the hive’s will for miles. The only hope is a Chrysalis Serum hidden in Mycolord Vhossuth’s private lab, deep in the Chokehold.

The journey to the lab is a descent into body horror:

A forest of Fungal Husks sways in unison, screaming the NPC’s name with stolen voices.

The Vein-Lord’s Larder holds half-digested prisoners in honeycomb pods, their faces visible through translucent fungus.

Vhossuth’s lab is a surgical nightmare, with the serum suspended above a living altar made of grafted cultists.

### Encounter table

### Goal
The cult exists to feed the Well until it achieves apotheosis, transforming from a cursed wishing pool into a full-fledged god of inverted mercy. They believe that by accumulating enough tragic bargains, the Well will eventually swell to encompass all reality - a world where every desire is granted in the most cosmically ironic way possible, where no good deed goes unpunished, and where kindness itself becomes a vector for suffering. Their sacred texts speak of the "Grand Irony," a state of existence where help and harm become indistinguishable, where every act of compassion secretly furthers despair. They don't see themselves as evil - in their twisted theology, they're the only ones honest enough to admit that all gifts come with hidden hooks, all love with unspoken expectations. By making these hidden costs explicit, they believe they're performing a sacred service.
### Ability

***Debt Collector's Touch*** - On a hit, the target must recall a broken promise (DC 16 Cha save or take 2d6 psychic damage).

### Abstract
A whispering cult of broken dreamers and cursed philanthropists, The Wailing Well gathers around a bottomless pit that grants wishes—but demands soul shards as payment. The Well is not water, but liquid longing, a sentient pool of collective desire that grows stronger with every wish granted. The cult serves as its "fishermen," luring desperate souls to its edge with promises of miracles, only to harvest the fallout when their wishes curdle into tragedy. Their sacred mandate? To feed the Well until it becomes a god of inverted mercy, capable of rewriting reality itself in the language of unintended consequences.

:
### Hierarchy
At the apex of the cult drifts Mother Marrow the Hollow, her body a living ledger of balanced miseries, her ribcage a cathedral of whispered pleas. She decides which wishes are worthy of the Well's attention and which must be paid for in advance. Beneath her floats Aurora the Lifekeeper, his brine-filled prison a reliquary of unintended truths, his songs harvested and sold by the Thimble Priests, who collect the tears of the heartbroken in tiny silver cups, distilling them into elixirs of borrowed grief. The Wish-Fishers are the cult's recruiters, their pockets lined with cursed coins that always roll toward despair; they haunt taverns and sickbeds, offering miracles to those too desperate to question the price.

The Paid-in-Full are former wishers who have settled their debts by becoming part of the Well's ecosystem—some grow extra mouths to scream its praises, others become living contracts, their skin inked with the terms of bargains yet to be fulfilled. At the bottom scuttle the Almost-Rans, those who came to the Well but lacked the courage to wish; their hesitation makes them perfect thieves of desire, stealing the dreams of others to feed the Well indirectly.

:
### History
The Wailing Well began with a single, desperate wish—the final gasp of **Mother Hesper the Unmourned**, a midwife who buried twelve stillborn children before kneeling at the black pool's edge. When she begged for *"just one living child,"* the Well answered—by transforming her next delivery into a squalling, immortal thing that aged backward, its cries peeling years from all who heard it. Hesper drowned the horror in the Well's depths, but as she did, the water whispered back: *"All life demands payment in kind."* By dawn, every mother in her village had birthed

similar monstrosities, and the Well had grown fat with their screams.  

Its true power awoke when the first **Thimble Priests** discovered they could distill wishes into liquid—pouring one man's plea for wealth into another's ears, only to watch gold coins burst from his eyes. Their first miracle, **The Cask of Borrowed Sorrows**, let an entire town trade their grief to a neighboring city—the donors forgot their dead, while the recipients drowned in phantom funerals. The cult grew, collecting desperate souls willing to bargain pieces of themselves—a widow's laughter sold to cure a lord's gout, a poet's voice traded for a soldier's steady hands.  

A faction sought to use the Well not just to grant wishes, but to *invert compassion itself*—to prove that every act of mercy was secretly cruelty in disguise. The ensuing **War of Balanced Scales** saw "healers" who cured plagues by redirecting them to orphans, and "benefactors" who fed the hungry by starving their own families. The conflict ended when Mother Hesper (or something wearing her skin) emerged from the Well and **drank half the world's prayers dry**—the survivors awoke with their palms pierced by invisible hooks, knowing only that they must **keep giving**.  

Their magnum opus—**The Grand Irony**—proved their ultimate thesis: *no good deed goes unpunished*. A kingdom's worth of charity curdled into self-destruction—hospitals that spread disease, alms that bred addiction, love letters that inspired murders. By the final accounting, only the cult remained, their hollow chests ringing with the echoes of every wish they'd twisted.  

Now, they haunt hospitals and wedding chapels alike, their **Thimble Priests** and **Debt-Scribes** measuring out mercy in draughts of venom. Their next revelation? **The Final Quenching**, where the world will learn the last truth: *"To wish is to owe—and the Well always collects."*  

### Timeline
- **Founding Era:** Mother Hesper makes her fatal wish during the **Birth of the Unchild**.  
- **Discovery Era:** The **Thimble Rite** is perfected, allowing pain to be traded like currency.  
- **Expansion Era:** The cult establishes **Hospices of Equal Measure** across the realm.  
- **Schism Era:** The **War of Balanced Scales** divides the cult over active vs. passive corruption.  
- **Ascendance Era:** The **Grand Irony** turns a kingdom's compassion into self-destruction.  
- **Present Era:** The cult prepares for **The Final Quenching**—the Well's apotheosis.

### Location and Base
The Cathedral of Balanced Sorrows hangs suspended like a grotesque chandelier over the Well's infinite black throat, its spires plunging downward into the abyss while its foundations gape open to the sky. Every surface weeps a thick, briny fluid that collects in shimmering pools before being swallowed by the Well below - these tears form momentary faces as they fall, each one silently mouthing the wish they died regretting. The stained glass windows glow with an eerie bioluminescence, each panel depicting legendary tragedies of misguided benevolence: a saint whose healing touch transferred wounds to innocent bystanders, a king whose wish for prosperity turned his subjects into golden statues, a lover whose plea for eternal devotion bound their beloved's soul to a weeping portrait.

The pews ripple disturbingly when touched - closer inspection reveals they're composed entirely of petrified hands fused together at the wrist, their fingers forever frozen in grasping supplication. Some still twitch occasionally, their brittle bones clicking like prayer beads. The floor between them is paved with teeth, each one inscribed with fragments of broken promises ("I'll always", "Never again", "I swear by"). Walking across them produces a sickening crunch followed by muffled sobs that seem to come from beneath.
:
### Pecularity
What makes the cult truly unsettling is their absolute sincerity. Unlike most evil organizations that revel in their wickedness, the Wailing Well's adherents genuinely believe they're helping people - they're just "honest" about the price. Their rituals are grotesque parodies of charity: a "healing ceremony" where diseases are transferred to innocent bystanders, a "prosperity blessing" that makes gold coins grow from a recipient's eyes. They keep meticulous ledgers of every transaction, noting down who owes what to whom in enormous flesh-bound books that scream when opened. The most disturbing aspect is their perverse mercy - they'll always warn wish-seekers about the cost, often in exacting detail, then watch with genuine sadness as the desperate ignore the warnings. Their signature mark is a "blessing" - a small, weeping hole drilled into the palm that can never be filled, a permanent reminder that all gifts leave voids.
:
### Public Perception
To the desperate, they're dark saints—the only ones who offer help without false promises. To rulers, they're a necessary evil—who else would take the beggars off the streets, even if they return... changed? But the wise fear them most for what they reveal: that every act of generosity in history has secretly carried this cult's taint. Their symbol—a **leaking thimble**—can be found scratched into the walls of orphanages and hospitals, a reminder that no good deed goes unrecorded.

#### Cursed Artefact 
## Shadowrend, the Eclipse Blade

*requires attunement*
}}
{{wide,columns:2,descriptive



#### Description
Forged from a shard of the **Black Moon**, a celestial body said to be the corpse of a slain god of night, Shadowrend is a blade that exists in a state of perpetual eclipse. Its blade is a **sliver of condensed void**, absorbing light so completely that it seems to warp space around it. When dormant, it appears as a matte-black longsword with a faint, starless sheen—but when awakened, it erupts with **violet-black flames** that flicker like dying stars, casting eerie, cold illumination.  

The crossguard is wrought in the shape of **twin crescent moons**, their curves cradling a hollow abyss that pulses faintly, as if breathing. The grip is wrapped in the **tanned hide of a sorrowsworn**, its leather unnaturally smooth and cold to the touch. When swung, the blade leaves behind **ghostly afterimages of extinguished constellations**, lingering for a heartbeat before dissolving into nothingness.  

#### **Properties**  

1. **Voidflame Ignition:**  
   - As a bonus action, the wielder can ignite or extinguish the blade’s **otherworldly flames**. While active:  
     - Melee attacks deal an additional **2d8 necrotic damage**.  
     - On a critical hit, the target’s **maximum HP is reduced** by the necrotic damage dealt until the next long rest.  
     - The flames emit **no heat**, only a bone-deep chill.  
:
2. **Umbral Sunder:**  
   - Against creatures native to the **Shadowfell**, or those with **Sunlight Sensitivity**, Shadowrend **ignores resistance** to slashing damage.  
   - If the target has **immunity** to slashing damage, the blade treats it as **resistance** instead.

### Mother Marrow the Hollow's Backstory
Elspeth the Kind was once a woman of warm hands and softer words, a healer whose name was spoken like a prayer in the fog-wrapped valleys of the Mourning Downs. Her touch mended fevers, her voice calmed agony, and her smile—small, tired, but always given freely—was said to ease the passing of even the most forsaken souls. Lords sent riders for her. Beggars crawled to her doorstep. And Elspeth, ever faithful, turned none away.

But when the Grey Pox came—a wasting plague that turned flesh to brittle ash and left only coughing ghosts behind—her salves failed. Her poultices burned. Her wards cracked. Her home became a hospice, and then a morgue. For every life she saved, ten slipped through her fingers. She begged the gods. She bartered with witches. She bled herself into offerings. But death only smiled, patient and unchanging.

Desperation led her to the Whispering Wood, a grove the locals feared and the wise forgot. There, beneath a weeping willow whose roots curled like arthritic fingers into a black and silent pond, she found the Well—a hole in the world, rimmed with bone-white stones and deeper than thought. It spoke to her.

The voice was her mother’s—long-dead, soft as a lullaby.
"One wish," it murmured. "One cure. Say the words, my child."

Broken by grief and sleepless sorrow, Elspeth whispered:
"No more sickness."

And the Well answered.

By sunrise, the Grey Pox was gone. But so were the villagers. Not dead, not living—transfigured. Statues of living salt, each etched in postures of horror, lips parted in final screams, eyes wide with petrified memory. Children clutched toys. Lovers reached for hands that crumbled in their grasp. The wind whistled through their hollowed mouths.

The Well spoke again, but not as her mother. Now it was legion—a thousand voices of the dying, layered like sediment.
"The sick must be sick. The pained must pain. To erase suffering is to erase the self. You asked for peace. You killed life."

Mad with guilt, Elspeth plunged her hands into the Well, seeking to undo her wish. But when she pulled them free, they were bone—skeletal, veined with darkness, tipped with talons shaped for grasping, not healing. She felt the pain of the world crawl beneath her skin, and it did not stop. The Well had hollowed her—and in that hollow, something else grew.

Now she walks the world as Mother Marrow, no longer healer, but herald of suffering in balance. She is not cruel—but neither is she merciful. To her, pain is currency, and she is its broker. She cured a tyrant’s battlefield wounds by infusing them into his beloved warhorse, and then sold the horse’s agony to a poet who longed to “feel what others feel.” She whispered insomnia into a widow’s dreams in exchange for her grief, which she buried in the roots of a willow and watered with sorrow. Her masterpiece, the Grand Equalization, came not through healing—but forgetting. She silenced the desires of an entire city, Velmire, and proved that peace is just emptiness that pretends to be kind.

The Well still whispers to her—sometimes as a friend, sometimes as a child, sometimes in the groaning cadence of dying lungs—and she listens. Always listening. For pain is inevitable, but its distribution… that is an art.

And Elspeth, the Kind?
She is now the canvas on which that art is painted.

### Aurora the Lifekeeper's Backstory
Lysander the Golden-Throated was born with a voice that could charm birds from the trees and coins from the stingiest miser's purse. But fame is a fickle lover, and when his patron grew bored of his songs, he found himself penniless, his voice hoarse from singing for scraps. In the depths of his humiliation, he heard rumors of the Wailing Well—a place where even the most impossible desires could be granted, for a price. He went not for wealth or love, but for the one thing he feared losing: his voice. "Let no one ever ignore me again," he wished, pressing his last silver coin into the Well's murky depths.

The Well answered with the Echo. At first, it seemed a gift—his songs now carried a haunting resonance, a second voice that harmonized with his own. But the Echo did not sing what Lysander willed; it sang truths. When he performed for the Duke of Harrowgate, his ballad of loyalty was undercut by the Echo's whisper: "Your wife takes the stableboy to bed." The Duke, in his rage, ordered Lysander's tongue cut out—but the Well's gift could not be silenced so easily. The Echo grew louder, its words twisting into prophecies that unraveled lives. A lullaby sung to a noble's child became a dirge foretelling the infant's death by drowning. A romantic ballad exposed a conspiracy that burned a city to the ground.

The Chainbreakers found him wandering the ruins of Harrowgate, his throat bloody from where he'd tried to claw the Echo out. They sealed him in a brine-filled bell jar, where his voice could be controlled. Now, as Aurora the Lifekeeper, he is the cult's most potent oracle—his songs pluck the secrets from men's souls like rotten fruit from a branch. His latest hymn, "The Well Will Swallow the Moon," is not a prophecy, but a warning: the Well is not a thing, but a hunger, and it is learning to wish for itself.

### Additional Notes For GMs
*Make every wish feel like a moral dilemma—the "right" choice should always require sacrificing someone else's happiness.*

### Code of Conduct
*"All gifts are loans written in blood"* is the cult's foundational law. Members must keep meticulous ledgers of every transaction, ensuring no kindness goes unpunished. Their holiest rite is **The Balancing**—when curing a blind man, they must inflict equal blindness elsewhere. To heal without collateral suffering is heresy. Even information comes at a price: answering a question requires the asker to first surrender a memory. The most sacred rule? Never warn of consequences in terms the wisher might understand—truth must be given in riddles that only make sense in hindsight.  
### Secret
The Wailing Well’s power is tied to the unfulfilled wish of its first victim—a woman named Elindra, who begged to hear her drowned daughter’s voice one last time. The well granted it… but twisted the wish. Now, the daughter’s voice is one of the countless whispers inside the Pactstone, and Elindra’s bones lie hidden in the well’s foundations.
:
Exploiting the Weakness:

- If Elindra’s bones are recovered and given a proper burial, the well’s magic weakens—wishes no longer require a voice as payment.

- The cult does not know this. They believe the well is an eternal force, not a grieving mother’s prison.

### Hook I
The party arrives in the mist-shrouded village of Blackmire, where the townsfolk speak in hushed tones of a terrible blessing—no child born in the last five years has ever cried. The midwives claim it began when a grieving mother, Mara Velsin, drowned herself in the Wailing Well after losing her infant to fever. Now, the village’s newborns are born silent, their first breaths stolen by unseen forces. The local priest, Brother Dain, believes this is a divine miracle, but the party is approached by Lyssa, Mara’s surviving daughter, who swears she hears her dead brother’s laughter in the well at night.

If the party investigates, they find the Cult of the Drowned Choir has infiltrated Blackmire, posing as healers who "bless" newborns with a drop of well water. The truth is far worse—the cult has bound the souls of the silent infants to the well, turning them into Whispering Shades, spectral children who lure others to the water’s edge. The deeper horror? Mara’s wish wasn’t for silence—it was "Let no mother bury her child again." The well twisted her plea, ensuring no child would ever cry… because none would live long enough to do so.

To break the curse, the party must descend into the well’s flooded catacombs, where the infants’ spirits drift like drowned fireflies. There, they face The Hollow Lullaby, a cultist who "sings" with the stolen voices of the dead. Destroying her releases the children’s souls—but the villagers, now accustomed to eerie silence, may not thank them for bringing back the sound of weeping.

### Hook II
A renowned opera house has canceled all performances after its star soprano, Isolde de Vaux, vanished mid-aria during her magnum opus, The Drowning Maiden. Witnesses say she clutched her throat as if choking, then fled into the night, her final note still hanging in the air like a ghost. The party is hired by Maestro Orsini, who claims Isolde was "cursed by a rival"—but the truth leads to the Wailing Well.

Investigating Isolde’s dressing room reveals a Pactstone fragment hidden in her jewelry box, along with sheet music for an unfinished song titled "The Last Wish." If played (requiring a Performance check), the notes manifest as liquid sound, forming visions of Isolde begging the well to "let her voice outlive her." The cult has taken her to the well, where they plan to dissolve her into its waters—transforming her into a Living Aria, a being of pure, cursed song that will "sing" the cult’s victims into the depths.

The party must infiltrate the cult’s next ritual, where Isolde, now half-transformed into swirling water and music, hovers above the well. The cultists, wearing masks of frozen screams, conduct her like an orchestra. If the party saves her, her voice is restored—but it now carries the well’s curse, forcing her to choose between silence or spreading its magic. If they fail, her final performance becomes a siren’s call, drawing every listener within miles to a watery grave.
